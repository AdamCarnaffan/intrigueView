Login credentials of more than half a million records belonging to vehicle tracking device company SVR Tracking have leaked online, potentially exposing the personal data and vehicle details of drivers and businesses using its service. Just two days ago, Viacom was found exposing the keys to its kingdom on an unsecured Amazon S3 server, and this data breach is yet another example of storing sensitive data on a misconfigured cloud server. The Kromtech Security Center was first to discover a wide-open, public-facing misconfigured Amazon Web Server (AWS) S3 cloud storage bucket containing a cache belonging to SVR that was left publicly accessible for an unknown period. Stands for Stolen Vehicle Records, the SVR Tracking service allows its customers to track their vehicles in real time by attaching a physical tracking device to vehicles in a discreet location, so their customers can monitor and recover them in case their vehicles are stolen. The leaked cache contained details of roughly 540,000 SVR accounts, including email addresses and passwords, as well as users\' vehicle data, like VIN (vehicle identification number), IMEI numbers of GPS devices. Since the leaked passwords were stored using SHA-1, a 20-years-old weak cryptographic hash function that was designed by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which can be cracked with ease. The leaked database also exposed 339 logs that contained photographs and data about vehicle status and maintenance records, along with a document with information on the 427 dealerships that use SVR\'s tracking services. Interestingly, the exposed database also contained information where exactly in the car the physical tracking unit was hidden. According to Kromtech, the total number of devices exposed \"could be much larger given the fact that many of the resellers or clients had large numbers of devices for tracking.\" Since SVR\'s car tracking device monitors a vehicle everywhere for the past 120 days, anyone with access to SVR users\' login credentials could both track a vehicle in real time and create a detailed log of every location the vehicle has visited using any internet connected device like a desktop, laptop, mobile phone or tablet. Eventually, the attacker could outright steal the vehicle or even rob a home when they know a car\'s owner is out. Kromtech responsible alerted the company of the misconfigured AWS S3 cloud storage bucket, which has since been secured. However, It is unclear whether the publically accessible data was possibly accessed by hackers or not. function aaFunction(){var n=document.getElementById(\"aim18502387354535050289\"),e=document.getElementById(\"aim28502387354535050289\"),s=document.getElementById(\"aim38502387354535050289\"),r=e.innerHTML,t=r.search(/\\x3C!-- adsense --\\x3E/gim);if(t>0){n.innerHTML=r.substr(0,t);var i=e.innerHTML=r.substr(t+16),a=i.search(/\\x3C!-- linkads --\\x3E/gim);if(a>0)e.innerHTML=i.substr(0,a),s.innerHTML=i.substr(a+16);else{var u=i.length,m=u/2,b=i.substr(0,m),c=i.substr(m),d=c.search(\" \"),H=c.substr(0,d),L=c.substr(d);e.innerHTML=b+H,s.innerHTML=L}}}aaFunction(); Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Home &#8250; Hacking News Swati Khandelwal Technical Writer, Security Blogger and IT Analyst.

But as with any sweeping reform, the progress also comes with some new opportunities for fraud. And phishers are loving HTTPS. On Tuesday, the phishing research and defense firm PhishLabs published new analysis showing that phishers have been adopting HTTPS more and more often on their sites. When you get a phishing email or text, the sites they lead to—that try to trick you into entering credentials, personal information, and so on—implement web encryption about 24 percent of the time now, PhishLabs found. That&#x27;s up from less than three percent at this time last year, and less than one percent two years ago. Some phishing sites come by HTTPS only incidentally, or as an added bonus. Phishers often hijack legitimate sites for their own uses, so the more HTTPS is deployed around the web overall, the more likely a that a phisher might compromise a site that implements it. But PhishLabs notes that phishers create their own sites almost as often as they steal those of others. In those cases, phishers actively chose to implement web encryption. The green padlock lends legitimacy, a patina of security that helps trick web users into trusting a site and giving up their valuable information. &quot;In two extremely prevalent types of phishes targeting PayPal and Apple, about 75 percent were using HTTPS sites,&quot; says Crane Hassold, a threat intelligence manager at PhishLabs who worked on the research. &quot;The attackers are making that choice even though this is not needed to complete the crime.&quot; Other researchers see the trend as well. During a 24-hour period this month, the anti-phishing firm PhishMe observed and analyzed over 200 examples of phishing pages that were using HTTPS. &quot;The HTTPS connection ensures that the data is encrypted when it is transmitted, but forged pages that falsely replicate an organization send the information to a criminal instead of the legitimate organizations,&quot; says Brendan Griffin, a threat intelligence manager and malware analyst at PhishMe. Web giants like Google have led a big push over the last few years to promote and even require HTTPS. And the non-profit Internet Security Research Group has been offering free verification certificates, which a site need for HTTPS to work, through its Let&#x27;s Encrypt initiative since last year. Let&#x27;s Encrypt, which is known as a &quot;certificate authority&quot; because it verifies web servers to implement encryption, has now issued more than 100 million certificates. &#x27;The fact that they&#x27;re taking a little bit of extra time to do it means it’s worthwhile to them.&#x27; These collective efforts have been paying off. In April 2016, 42 percent of page loads on the Firefox browser were to encrypted sites. In January the number hit 50 percent, and it&#x27;s now up to an impressive 67 percent. But advocates have long known that the privacy and security gains would come with some detrimental side effects. &quot;HTTPS is taking off at a rate that I think is really unprecedented for any change on the web,&quot; says Josh Aas, the executive director of ISRG. &quot;The whole web becoming encrypted is really, really good for people. And of course the bad guys are going to follow along down that trend, that’s to be expected, but in the overall picture the situation is much better than it was.&quot; Certificate authorities like ISRG argue that their scope is too limited to meaningfully police the web. They don&#x27;t have the resources, means, or opportunity to screen sites for attacks like phishing or malware. Besides, a site often won&#x27;t have any content on it at all yet when a domain owner requests an encryption certificate. And even if certificate authorities did have the resources and expertise to make content-based decisions, they don&#x27;t have the ability to really penalize sites. Revoking an HTTPS certificate doesn&#x27;t take a site down or remove abusive content. PhishLabs&#x27; Hassold notes also that the real problem anyway isn&#x27;t phishers getting a certificate and implementing HTTPS; it&#x27;s the green padlock they gain that then gives consumers a false sense of security. Where the padlock simply indicates that traffic between the server and the user&#x27;s browser is encrypted and protected against interception, consumers often assume that a green padlock means that the site is more generally secure. &quot;The messaging from the security community has been so mixed that a lot of internet users believe that a green padlock means a site is safe and legitimate when it actually doesn’t,&quot; Hassold says. &quot;So that’s why we’re seeing the big explosion of HTTPS phish. The phishers don’t have to get an SSL certificate, but the fact that they&#x27;re taking a little bit of extra time to do it means it’s worthwhile to them.&quot; And though the green padlock has essentially been the mascot of the HTTPS movement over the last few years, Aas agrees that it&#x27;s too reductive. &quot;The problem with the green lock is that it really over-promises,&quot; he says. &quot;I don’t think that browsers should be showing the green lock when a webpage is merely encrypted with HTTPS. I think it’s misleading and inappropriate. What I would rather is when a website has HTTPS you should see nothing, and without HTTPS your browser should indicate that there’s a problem. You have to replace the carrot with a stick.&quot; For the average internet user, the important thing is still following the basic steps to avoid being drawn in by phishing schemes . And don&#x27;t assume that any page that has HTTPS contains legitimate and authentic content. It&#x27;s a green padlock, not a silver bullet.

These simple math tricks can help you perform calculations more quickly and easily. They also come in handy if you want to impress your teacher, parents, or friends. If you multiply 6 by an even number, the answer will end with the same digit. The number in the tens place will be half of the number in the ones place. Example : 6 x 4 &#61; 24 The answer is 2. The answer is 37. The answer is the three digit number Examples : 371371 gives you 371 or 552552 gives you 552. The result will be a six digit number that repeats the three digit number. Example : 456 becomes 456456. This is a quick way to multiply two digit numbers by 11 in your head. Examples : 72 x 11 &#61; 792 57 x 11 &#61; 5 _ 7, but 5 &#43; 7 &#61; 12, so put 2 in the space and add the 1 to the 5 to get 627 To remember the first seven digits of pi , count the number of letters in each word of the sentence: &#34;How I wish I could calculate pi.&#34; This gives 3.141592 The number will contain the digits 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8.  Example : The number 6 yields the answer 714285.

The same goes for Uber&#x2019;s AI that books you a ride. The Danish computer scientist helped build the machine learning platforms that both companies use throughout their operations, from the engineering to the marketing departments. Lange has just done the same at video game platform maker Unity, with the goal of evolving robo characters into more complex and nuanced playing companions than a human could program. Lange doesn&#x2019;t shy away from the oft-hyped term &#x201C;artificial intelligence&#x201D;&#x2014; provided the machines really do learn how to respond to users&#x2019; needs. But he&#x2019;s skeptical of prospects for so-called artificial general intelligence, or AGI&#x2014;the Westworld -style vision of a synthetic consciousness. Lange has equally strong views on what does not count as intelligent, such as Alexa and Siri, which follow scripts written by humans, rather than thinking for themselves. Lange should know: He lead the design GM&#x2019;s OnStar, the first widespread computerized assistant, way back in the late 1990s. Fast Company spoke with Lange about nuances between real and phony AI, misunderstandings in pop culture, and the prospect of a robot uprising. He also described emerging technologies such as adversarial networks&#x2014;a battle of wits between AIs that forces each to get smarter. What follows are highlights from a longer conversation. Fast Company: Can you define artificial intelligence? Is it even definable? Danny Lange: To me, there are two key aspects. One is external, and one is internal. So the external one is really in the perception. Does the system seem to be very reasonable? Does it almost seem like there&#x2019;s a human hiding behind the system, interacting with me and making me feel comfortable? That doesn&#x2019;t have to be voice. It can also just be going to an Amazon web page and shopping around. But I get this sense that the system knows a lot about what I want and helps me get the thing that I want. The other side is the internal thing. This is where I think a disruption is under way. And that is the move . . . to systems that learn instead of being programmed. And because they learn from the data, they are able to capture much more nuanced patterns in our data than any programmer can ever do. When that comes together, I feel that we are crossing a line, and we start dealing with something that is truly AI. FC: So, truly AI. Are we talking something like general intelligence? DL: No. I think general intelligence is more of a philosophical discussion . . . I don&#x2019;t know what exactly self-awareness is and conscious is . . . I don&#x2019;t think the system is really reasoning to that extent. But it is still able to learn from the interaction and improve over time as more and more interactions take place. FC: Is the term &#x201C;AI&#x201D; being used too broadly? I know some people don&#x2019;t like, for example, using the term &#x201C;artificial intelligence&#x201D; to refer to machine learning. DL: I think that the term has become more of a broad, almost marketing-driven term. And I&#x2019;m probably okay with that. What matters is what people think of when they hear this. They think of systems that give people&#x2014;the customer or the owner of the robot or whatever&#x2014;the sense that this thing does have some kind of intelligence in its behavior, and it has the learning capability. I [can&#x2019;t] think of an AI system that doesn&#x2019;t have machine learning at its core. FC: So is a system that reads CT scans or an MRI, looking for a tumor, is that AI? DL: If it [learned from examples] hand-curated or hand-labeled by doctors, so doctors basically interpret it, that&#x2019;s definitely not AI. It&#x2019;s using machine learning technology, but they are missing the point by inserting human expertise into the loop. Because now we&#x2019;re sort of back to human programming of the system . . . AI would have been giving the computer treatment data and results, [allowing it to] start developing an ability to do the diagnosis, propose some suggestions for treatment, measure the output of the treatment, and constantly adjust and learn. FC: What are the other buzzword concepts that we should be thinking about beyond AI/ML? DL: An adversarial network is a key. So for instance, I may build a machine learning system that detects a fake product review or detects fake news. But I could also have a machine learning system that learns to generate a fake product review or fake news . . . As one of them gets better at detecting fake news, the opponent gets better at generating fake news, because it learns from the feedback loop. FC: When I mention to friends that I&#x2019;m writing something about AI, they often make a joke about computers taking over the world and killing us. Is that a legitimate fear? DL: Maybe five, 10 years ago, I often used this scary but realistic scenario. [First] you have a drone [that] a machine learning system has learned to fly on its own. And nowadays we do have those. Secondly, you equip that drone with a high-definition camera, and you put computer vision with face-recognition software in there. It will recognize &#x201C;bad people&#x201D;&#x2014;people you don&#x2019;t like, people in places they are not supposed to be. Then thirdly, you equip that thing with the ability to eliminate those people. Is it feasible? Yep. So, that&#x2019;s not really a distant future. You could do that today . . . FC: I understand that a machine could kill people. But will a machine want to kill people? That seems to go back to that philosophical notion of consciousness. DL: From a strict technical perspective, we always look for the rewards function that drives the machine . . . The rewards function in an Amazon system is, get the customer to click the purchase button. At Netflix, it&#x2019;s get the customer to click on one of our TV shows.&#xA0;What is the rewards function of a drone? Find the bad guys and eliminate them . . . It&#x2019;s really what you define as the end goal of the system [that matters]. FC: So if you don&#x2019;t define it properly, you can have some unintended consequences? DL: Yeah. FC: I know a lot of people started freaking out when the two Facebook bots began to speak to each other in their own invented language . Is that as scary as some people thought it was? DL: It&#x2019;s not scary. It&#x2019;s just that you have two learning systems. We have to get used to this. For years and years, for decades, moms and dads told their kids that computers can only do what they&#x2019;re programmed to do. And they were wrong, because now the computers can learn. They can now change that behavior. In that case of communication between computers, if the rewards function is to optimize the computer&#x2019;s ability to communicate with each other, they will probably change the language over time to optimize the communication&#x2014;using fewer letters, using better confirmation on [whether they] agree or disagree, things like that. FC: Are there things you hear people say&#x2014;whether it&#x2019;s the general public or marketing people&#x2014;that make you cringe? DL: I think a lot about the voice systems like Siri and Alexa. They&#x2019;re more like branded, hardwired systems, built to give you a safe voice interaction with their corporate owners&#x2026; All Siri&#x2019;s jokes are written by creative writers in Cupertino&#x2014;nothing that Siri learned. You&#x2019;re aware of this famous example where Microsoft launched a chatbot [named Tay] that actually learned from human interaction, yeah? It got pretty nasty. If you are a big major brand, like Apple, Google, or Amazon, you can&#x2019;t have that. So that&#x2019;s why these systems are highly branded experiences, which apparently people really like, and that&#x2019;s fine. But they are not AI. FC: Anything else that you see as common misunderstandings? DL: We are often focused on the risks and the problems, but there are also pretty impressive things in the area of using, say, computer vision to equip systems with the ability to see things. I saw an example of a system on a tractor that would look for weed in a field and basically, with an adjustable nozzle, spray Roundup on the weed only and not on your vegetables. So there are a lot of these technologies that can make our world greener, more sustainable. And sometimes there&#x2019;s an overly strong bias on how these things are going to make our lives harder going forward. Related: How To Stop Worrying And Love The Great AI War Of 2018&#xA0; FC: Anything else you think we need to know about AI? DL: The key message is, you have a learning system, and that&#x2019;s the disruption . . . Your computer can do more than it&#x2019;s told to do because it gets the data and it learns from it, and the loop makes it improve endlessly.', 0, 0, 5, 1),

And that means making the most powerful rocket ever. NASA gave photographer Vincent Fournier exclusive access to the testing and preparations for the mission, and our photographer spent 20 days at five facilities to capture how engineers build and test (and test, and test) the unprecedentedly large rocket and its human-carrying capsule. Engineers model everything from the orientation of rocket parts during transit to the way engine vibrations affect other components of the launch system. They’re building teeny models of the rocket and sticking them in wind tunnels; enlarging the agency’s trusty barge Pegasus to ferry massive hunks of metal from NASA’s Michoud facility in Louisiana to Stennis Space Center in Mississippi and finally to Kennedy Space Center in Florida; and testing the fuel tanks by using hydraulic cylinders that apply millions of pounds of crushing forces to mimic launch and flight. “You know ‘measure twice, cut once’?” says Andy Schorr, a manager of the rocket’s payload integration at NASA. “We take that to a whole new level.” Here’s what goes on before the rocket goes up. Fuel tank dome, Michoud Assembly Facility, Louisiana (Above): NASA is assembling most of the core stage of the rocket using a technique called friction stir welding: Cylinders of metal rotate between aluminum slabs, heating them to a butter like consistency. The metal sections then meld together without any cracks or contaminants. After sanding the joins by hand, technicians scan them for defects using ultrasound and X-rays. Hydrogen fuel tank, Michoud Assembly Facility: The 130-foot-tall hydrogen fuel tank for the rocket is so unwieldy and delicate that moving it from a horizontal to a vertical position (or vice versa) requires three days, two GPS-enabled cranes, and a laser alignment system to position the hardware. The man in the chair? He’s there to push the emergency Stop button. Just in case. Launch vehicle stage adapter, Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama: A pair of NASA technicians will spend three months hand-spraying insulation onto this 28-foot-tall adapter, which connects the core stage to the capsule stage. They’ve practiced for hundreds of hours on more than 50 test sprays so they can achieve a perfectly even layer every time. The polyurethane foam is whitish when it’s sprayed but turns iconic rocket orange when exposed to UV light at liftoff. I&#8217;m sorry; your browser does not support HTML5 video in WebM with VP8 or MP4 with H.264. Dome weld tool, Michoud Assembly Facility, Louisiana: To ensure a perfectly welded fuel tank dome, a crew of six takes a day or two just to clamp all the hardware in place on this Circumferential Dome Weld Tool. The blue bars align the two sections of the dome, and after the weld is complete, the crew uses an elaborate ceiling-mounted pulley system to lift the dome off the tool. RS-25 engines, Stennis Space Center, Mississippi: Four of these engines will make the SLS go; they can withstand temperatures from –423° F (the fuel stored in the tanks) to 6,000° F (the fuel at ignition). A contractor has updated them to produce a combined 2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, and engineers have recently finished modeling the acoustics around the bell-shaped nozzles to ensure they can tolerate those bone-rattling vibration patterns. Intertank, Michoud Assembly Facility, Louisiana: The rocket’s two unprecedentedly powerful boosters attach to the intertank, the core stage’s sturdiest part. It’s too thick to weld together, so instead the intertank is constructed from 7,500 bolts and eight panels, whose holes have been oh-so-carefully aligned with an assembly jig (the scaffolding) and inspected with X-rays. After it&#8217;s constructed, NASA stress-tests it with more than 100 hydraulic actuators, some as heavy as cars. Systems Integration Test Facility, Marshall Space Flight Center: Five miles of riotous wiring connects 46 avionics boxes, which control everything from navigation to the engines. Each box is tested in thermal chambers and on very large shake tables to see how they hold up to extreme heat, cold, and vibration. Then they’re all hooked together on these racks—curved to mimic the rocket—to run full launch simulations. Systems Integration Test Facility, Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama: The outer surface of these avionics racks hosts several computers that simulate the rocket’s environment on its entire trajectory, from liftoff to booster separation. Accompanied by realistic animations, the simulation feeds in flaming hot and space-cold temperatures to the sensors, delivers faux coordinates to the flight computer, and sends other flight “data” via 5 miles of cabling. Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel, Langley Research Center, Virginia: To make sure the rocket can withstand the supersonic winds of liftoff and flight, NASA engineers test every portion of its trajectory in wind tunnels. This three-foot steel scale model is coated with pastel pink paint that glows intensely neon under a blacklight depending on how much oxygen hits it. (Oxygen is a proxy for pressure in these tests.) Engineers can then determine exactly what forces the wind is exerting on the rocket and ensure that when the boosters separate from the rocket, they won’t, say, whip around and hit the thing. Orion test capsule, Johnson Space Center, Texas: The Navy uses a test capsule to practice retrieving astronauts from the ocean after Orion splashes down. Another is undergoing structural tests to see how it will fare if lightning strikes near the launch pad. NASA uses the capsule below to develop procedures for emergency situations. In one, astronauts would stuff dense stowage bags around them to block intense radiation from sudden solar flares. Engine test fire, Stennis Space Center, Mississippi:', 0, 0, 5, 1),

But now one researcher has dug up a new collection of bugs in email programs that in many cases strip away even the existing, imperfect protections against email impersonation, allowing anyone to undetectably spoof a message with no hint at all to the recipient. On Tuesday, security researcher and programmer Sabri Haddouche revealed Mailsploit, an array of methods for spoofing email in more than a dozen common email clients, including Apple Mail for iOS and macOS, Mozilla&#x27;s Thunderbird, Microsoft Mail, and Outlook 2016, as well as a long list of less common clients including Opera Mail, Airmail , Spark, Guerrilla Mail and Aol Mail. By combining the bugs in those email clients with quirks in how operating systems handle certain kinds of text, Haddouche was able to craft email headers that, to the recipient, give every indication of having been sent from whatever address the fraudster chooses. The potential for phishing schemes is enormous. A demo Haddouche has made available on his website describing the Mailsploit attack lets anyone send emails from any address they choose; think potus@whitehouse.gov, tcook@apple.com, john.podesta@gmail.com or any other corporate executive, politician, friend, family member, or associate that might trick someone into giving up their secrets. Thanks to Mailsploit&#x27;s tricks, no amount of scrutiny in the email client can reveal the fakery. &quot;This makes these spoofed emails virtually unstoppable at this point in time,&quot; writes Haddouche, who works as a developer for secure messaging service Wire. Email spoofing is a hacker trick as old as email itself. But over the years, administrators of email servers have increasingly adopted authentication systems, most recently one known as Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance, which blocks spoofed emails by carefully filtering out those whose headers pretend to come from a different source than the server that sent them. Partly as a result, phishers today generally have to use fake domains—the part of the email address after the &quot;@&quot;—that resemble real ones, or cram real-looking domains into the &quot;name&quot; field of their email. Either case is fairly easy to spot, if you&#x27;re careful to hover over or click on the &quot;from&quot; field of any suspicious-looking email. &#x27;This makes these spoofed emails virtually unstoppable at this point in time.&#x27; But Mailsploit&#x27;s tricks defeat DMARC by exploiting how email servers handle text data differently than desktop and mobile operating systems. By crafting email headers to take advantage of flawed implementation of a 25-year-old system for coding ASCII characters in email headers known as RFC-1342, and the idiosyncrasies of how Windows, Android, iOS, and macOS handle text, Haddouche has shown that he can trick email servers into reading email headers one way, while email client programs read them differently. &quot;The cleverness of this attack is that everything comes from the right source from the perspective of the mail server, but at the moment it’s displayed to the user it comes from someone else,&quot; says Dan Kaminsky, a protocol-focused security researcher and chief scientist at cybersecurity firm White Ops. &quot;The authentication system for the server sees one thing. The authentication system for humans sees another.&quot; Haddouche says he contacted all of the affected firms months ago to warn them about the vulnerabilities he&#x27;s found. Yahoo Mail, Protonmail and Hushmail have already fixed their bugs, while Apple and Microsoft have told Haddouche they&#x27;re working on a fix, he says. A Microsoft spokesperson wrote to WIRED to note that Outlook.com, Office 365, and Exchange 2016 aren&#x27;t affected by the attack. Most other affected services haven&#x27;t responded, Haddouche says. Haddouche&#x27;s full list of affected email clients and their responses to his Mailsploit research is here . 1 Mozilla and Opera, Haddouche says, both told him they don&#x27;t plan to fix their Mailsploit bugs, instead describing them as server-side problems. (On Wednesday, a Thunderbird developer Jörg Knobloch wrote to WIRED to note that Thunderbird will make a patch avaiable in the next 24 hours.) Blaming the server, rather than the email client, may be more than just a lazy dodge: Haddouche tells WIRED that email providers and firewalls can also be set to filter out his attack, even if email clients remain vulnerable. 1 Beyond the specific bugs Mailsploit highlights, Haddouche&#x27;s research points to a more fundamental problem with email authentication, says Kaminsky. Security add-ons for email like DMARC were designed to stop spam, not targeted spoofing, he points out. The fact that its whitelisting function also prevents most spoofing is almost an accident, he argues, and one that actually guarantees an email comes from who it appears to come from. &quot;This all part of the goop of email being a &#x27;90s protocol before security was a big deal,&quot; Kaminsky says. &quot;The system that accidentally prevents you from pretending to be the president of the US is good enough for spam protection, but it’s not good enough for phishing protection.&quot; Haddouche recommends that users stay tuned for more security updates to their email clients to fix the Mailsploit bugs, and that they consider switching in general to secure messengers like Wire, Whatsapp or Signal, which use more robust authentication mechanisms. And in the meantime, it&#x27;s always wise to treat emails with caution. Before opening an attachment or even clicking a link, it&#x27;s worth reaching out to the person via another channel for confirmation the message comes from who it claims to come from. And if you do get a message from potus@whitehouse.gov, don&#x27;t give him your PayPal password. 1 Updated 12/6/2017 at 5:55 pm EST to include comments from Microsoft and a Thunderbird developer.

But while they’re an imperfect security solution to begin with, putting in your best effort will provide an immediate security boost. Don’t think of the following tips as suggestions. Think of them as essentials, as important to your daily life as brushing your teeth or eating your vegetables. (Also, eat more vegetables.) 1. Use a password manager. A good password manager, like 1Password or LastPass , creates strong, unique passwords for all of your accounts. That means that if one of your passwords does get caught up in a data breach, criminals won&#x27;t have the keys to the rest of your online services. The best ones sync across desktop and mobile, and have autocomplete powers. Now, rather than having to memorize dozens of meticulously crafted passwords, you just have to remember one master key. How do you make it as robust as possible? Read on. 2. Go long. Despite what all those prompts for unique characters and uppercase letters might have you believe, length matters more than complexity. Once you get into the 12-15 character range, it becomes way harder for a hacker to brute force, much less guess, your password. One caveat: Don’t just string together pop culture references or use simple patterns. Mix it up! Live a little! A quick for instance: &quot;g0be@r$&quot; does you way less favors than &quot;chitown banana skinnydip.&quot; 3. Keep &#x27;em separated. If and when you do deploy those special characters—which, if you opt against a password manager, lots of input fields will force you to—try not to bunch them all together at the beginning or end. That’s what everyone else does, which means that’s what bad guys are looking for. Instead, space them out throughout your password to make the guesswork extra tricky. 4. Don’t change a thing. You know how your corporate IT manager keeps making you change your password every three months? Your corporate IT manager is wrong. The less often you change your password, the less likely you are to forget it, or to fall into patterns—like just changing a number at the end each time—that make them easier to crack. 5. Single-serve only. If you’re on the password manager train, you’re already all over this. But if you can’t be bothered, at the very least make sure that you don’t reuse passwords across different accounts. If you do, a retailer breach you have no control over could end up costing your banking password. See for yourself: The website Have I Been Pwned has nearly 5 billion compromised accounts on file—if yours is one of them, there’s a chance your favorite password might already be toast. 6. Don’t trust your browser. A convenient shortcut to remembering all those passwords, or getting a paid password manager account, is letting your browser remember them for you. You’ve seen the option yourself. You probably even use it on at least one site. Don’t! The option is convenient, but the underpinning security is often undocumented, and it doesn&#x27;t require that your password actually be, you know, good . If you need a free and easy option, go with a password manager like Dashlane instead of trusting everything to Chrome. 7. Add two-factor too. Hate to say it, but these days not even a password is enough. Many of the services you use today—social networks, banks, Google, and so on—offer an added layer of protection. It can come in the form of a code sent to your phone via SMS, or if you want to step it up, through software solutions like Google Authenticator or hardware like a YubiKey. SMS should be enough for most people; just know that like many entry level security precautions, it&#x27;s not perfect . More Tips for Civilians : One you master password tips, lock down your smartphone , keep yourself secure from phishers , know how to deal with getting doxed , and if you have kids, keep them safe online . Activist? Journalist? Politician? Consider Yourself a Target : Start by encrypting everything , sign up for Google Advanced Protection , take a tour of Tor , and deploy physical measures to increase your digital security.

(My last one was about werewolf billionaires. It was fiction.) And I’ve watched technology infiltrate countless trades and crafts, oftentimes improving how people do their jobs, all while passing storytellers by. Where’s the technology that can make me better at my job? Where’s the computational system that will optimize my prose? Hammond and Brooke agreed to collaborate with me on a simple experiment: Can an algorithm help me write a better story? I began by giving them a collection of my 50 favorite sci-fi stories—a mix of golden-age classics and some more recent stuff. (We decided I’d write a science-fiction piece, both for the obvious reasons and because sci-fi is easy to identify.) They used their program to compare my stories to a mass of other stories. First they came back to me with a series of stylistic guidelines that would make my story as much like the samples as possible—things like there had to be four speaking characters and a certain percentage of the text had to be dialog. Then they sent me a set of 14 rules, derived from a process called topic modeling, that would govern my story’s main topics and themes. All I had to do was start writing. Hammond and Brooke created a web-based interface through which their algorithm, called SciFiQ, could tell me, on the textual equivalent of the atomic level, how closely every single detail of my writing matched the details in my 50 favorite works. (I’m talking “nouns per 100 words” level.) When I typed in a word or phrase and it was more than a little different than what SciFiQ had in mind, the interface would light up red or purple. When I fixed the offending word or phrase, the interface would turn green. The key, obviously, was the texts that I selected: “Vaster than Empires and More Slow” by Ursula K. Le Guin, “The Father-Thing” by Philip K. Dick, “There Will Come Soft Rains” by Ray Bradbury—I can’t list them all, but you get the idea. I wanted to write something incredible, so I picked stories I thought were incredible. Whether that’s what I got might be another story. “Topic modeling,” Hammond says of the process he and Brooke used to create the 14 rules, “is mathematically sophisticated but otherwise stupid. The algorithm looks for words that tend to occur near one another in a very large corpus of text.” Based on how frequently the words appear together, Hammond determined what my story had to be about. For instance, after finding clusters of words throughout the texts that suggested extraterrestrial worlds and beings, he gave me rule number one: “The story should be set on a planet other than Earth.” The algorithm affected the story much more than I thought it would. Rule number one above seemed to conflict with rule number nine: “Include a scene set on a traditional Earth farm, with apple trees and corn fields.” The only way I could figure out how to follow both rules was to have someone on Earth viewing another planet. Which, I have to say, I like—the feeling that you’re watching helplessly as faraway events transpire. That suits our time, doesn’t it? “Profitable and marketable,” Ed said. “I cannot stress that enough.” “Profitable and marketable,” Anne murmured in agreement. The man at the viewer sucked out his face with a faint squelch and, with no acknowledgment of either Anne or Ed, began to pack up as quickly as possible. Anne had overdressed for her first day, obviously. Ed was night supervisor, but he was wearing blue-and-green overalls. The guy at the viewer was in head-to-toe sweats. His sallow eyes were exhausted 3 . He emanated a grotesque odor of off-brand bleach, and it burned the inside of Anne’s nostrils. And she was wearing her best outfit, the pencil-­skirt outfit she’d bought for her dissertation defense. What most writers and readers consider style (a recognizable way with words) is not what the algorithm considers style. It was developed to analyze average sentence length, variance in paragraph length, verbs per 100 words, and dozens of other statistics and patterns that my story would have to follow. “Once upon a time,” Ed continued, “people were interested in the Other world just because it was another world. There was discovery. Then there was building the telescopes, carrying the mercury to the translunar observatories, constructing the antigravity bases, the discs within discs of whirling silver the size of cities to capture the light.” The sallow man Anne was replacing misted the inside of the viewer with antiseptic spray and gently rubbed the screen down with a paper towel. Nodding curtly to each of them in turn, he half-jogged out the door. They were apparently not to be introduced. Her coworker couldn’t wait to be gone. “If you’re curious, go to the archives. I know, you’re a full prof, full xenologist. I know you’ve spent 10 years in the archives already, but you’ve got four hours tonight, well, three hours and 42 minutes. The archives have a hundred million hours cross-referenced. Your job is to keep looking to find something so we can justify keeping the lights on here.” “I understand.” “This light here,” he said, tapping the lamp. The glow from the viewer that no one was looking into unnerved Anne. The Other world, 1,564 light-years away, was flowing brightly 4 and glamorously 5 into the machine, unobserved, while Ed gave what must be his boilerplate orientation speech. I wrote a rough draft, based on the rules and guidelines, and dropped it into the interface. The first thing SciFiQ told me was that I used too few adverbs. I’ve always been taught to cut anything ending in ly , and I had to go back over the story putting in adverbs. Absurdly, good science fiction has a lot of adverbs. It wasn’t just adverbs either. It was adverbs per 100 words . So they had to be sprinkled throughout. “Nobody cares. That’s the thing to remember. While you’re here, I’ll be making phone calls to the South China coast begging for cash. Help me out. Keep the lights on here to keep an eye on there. That’s our motto now.” “Curiosity isn’t enough,” she said. “Curiosity isn’t enough. Exactly. You’re starting to understand. When people with money, people who matter, think of the Other, they think of aliens who have been dead for 1,500 years. It’s a nightmare, in a way, a planet of corpses who don’t know the oblivion they have momentarily escaped with us. Everybody knows. If they were ever going to find their way to us, they probably already would have. And if they’re looking at us, which they probably aren’t, what would we have to say to them? So it makes everybody sad, that there’s intelligent life out there and it doesn’t matter much. And sad is a hard sell.” Ed was obviously wrapping up. “You’re here to see, not to have insight. You will no doubt be struck by the reality of a planet so similar to ours, so distant from ours, and you will think deep thoughts about the loneliness of the cosmos. You may come to think even about the fate of a universe that is probably one of many universes, exemplified only by the fact that the universe that we happen to reside in happens to have created observers. Don’t bother sharing these digressions. They have already been written down by people who are 10,000 times more perspicacious than you and I and still managed to die in comprehensive obscurity.” The algorithm also told me what percentage of text should be dialog and how much of that dialog should come from female characters. This is where things get embarrassing. Turns out that, based on the stories I chose, only 16. 1 percent of the dialog could be from a woman’s point of view. Which is a crazily low number. Female writers historically write 40 to 50 percent of their dialog for female characters, male writers about 20 percent; so even by the shitty standards of male writers and history, this is appalling. It meant I had to make Anne shy and scholarly, and I had to make all the men around her bloviating assholes. Otherwise the dialog numbers wouldn’t work out. “Profitable and marketable,” 6 Anne repeated. “That’s correct. So tonight you have fewer than four hours to look at Othertribespeople on a ring of the lesser Chekhovs. Nobody knows much about them. They might have some new medicine. Anything that might have salable value, report.” The female dialog thing is still bugging me. If I had chosen a different 50 stories, or even changed one of the 50 stories, there would be a different outcome. I need to start reading better science fiction. “So I should call you if I see something new?” 7 “Call me if you see an Other holding up a sign that says, ‘Hello, Earth. It’s us up here.’ ” ______ At its peak, the Institution for the Study of Extraterrestrial Life had employed 264 fully trained researchers at the banks of screens. The mania for the Other had gripped the world, and every school devoted a class a week to its study. Universities all over the world had Other departments. Biologists handled the various pockets of life discovered in the rest of the universe, slimes mutating fiercely but drably on dozens of freezing or burning hells. The Other was its own field. The similarity had come as an existential shock to the earth. A planet 1,564 light-years away had forests that were not dissimilar to Earth’s forests. They had animals that were not that unlike the remaining animals on Earth. And they had the Others, who lived in cities, with streets, or in villages, or in tribes, just like us. The Others wore clothes. They fell in love. They wrote books. They kept time. They had laws. The odds of two worlds being conjured by chance at such similar points in their development—the Other was roughly at Earth’s 1964—had to mean something. The anthropic principle was considered proven. The universe could only exist under conditions in which ourselves and the Others were there to witness it. Those were the days when children, like Anne when she was a kid, wore pajamas with patterns of glublefrings gamboling among the tzitziglug trees, and everybody called it The Yonder. But all novelty eventually wears off. The natural market for the shock of recognition is perishingly small. Rule number 11: “Engage the sublime. Consider using the following words: vast, gigantic, strange, radiance, mystery, brilliance, fantastic, and spooky.” Alone in the vast 8 dark room, Anne wiped down the viewer again, just to be sure. She understood why there had been so many conspiracies in the days after discovery. It was like the machine fabricated the planet. Anne placed her face inside. The sucking in of the face curtains sealed her. She was hovering over a planet on the other side of the galaxy, 20 feet over a small group of Othertribespeople at night, fishing. The quality of the screen was so impeccable that the sense of her own body dissolved, and she was a floating dot. There was no comparison to watching a tape; this was live, or rather it was live 1,564 years ago. The tribe grouped tightly around a mountain stream. The males held torches up to the water, where a flurry of small fishes roiled on or under the surface, and a female Other poised, a spear in her hand, waiting for a gallack. They were huge, the gallacks, nearly the size of an Other. A single fish could feed a group of tribespeople for a month of desert season. The algorithm distinguishes between the “literariness” and “colloquialness” of any given word, and I had to strike the right balance between the two kinds. My number of literary words was apparently too high, so I had to go through the story replacing words like scarlet with words like red . Anne wanted to look a bit more closely. She reached down and her screen went blank. She had zoomed too far. She pulled up with a clenched fist and an elbow curl, and she was among the clouds above the mountains. The fire of the tribe’s torches made a red 9 and blue dot in the center. She pushed down slowly, adjusting. She had asked one of her dissertation supervisors what it was like working on the screens and he had told her it was like being an impotent god, and the description was precise. Delicately, tentatively, Anne focused on the face of the Other woman holding a spear. Sometimes a gallack might not come to light for hours, and when it did, it offered maybe three seconds of its purple-streaked skull bone for a strike. The Otherwoman’s eyes had narrowed sharply in concentration, her eyes small, even for the eyes of the Others, who had no nasal bridge, and whose button noses, like tiny dogs, were considerably more powerful than a human nose. A horrific violence lurked in her gaze. The Others stood so still, so intently and contentedly waiting for a slimy mammoth fish to rise out of the waters. Why was she watching this? The hope was that someone would hurt themselves in the hunt, and that the tribe would use an herb that had found an analogue in the surviving jungles on Earth to repair the damage. That’s how they had found that the bark of the Amazonian gluttaree had curative properties for Bell’s palsy. That was profitable and marketable. Only the leaves on the Other trees—she thought they were hualintratras, or maybe grubgrubs— moved at all 10 . The shimmering and the stillness were so different from the recordings, somehow. The recordings were always significant. That was the difference. Something had always happened to make them worth watching, worth preserving. The Othertribespeople were just waiting around for a gallack. Maybe the gallack would come, or maybe it wouldn’t. I loved writing descriptions of the Other planet, but I could only include a few. My story had to consist of about 26 percent dialog, so every time I wrote a bit of descriptive non-dialog, I knew I’d have to make up for it elsewhere with some talking. It was like working out probabilities when you’re playing poker. It wouldn’t really matter if she snuck off to the city for 20 minutes, would it? She marked the place of the tribe, flicked up with a curled fist, saw the planet whole for a second, found the biggest dot, centered herself visually, and pushed down. She landed accidentally in a funeral, right in the middle of the green twigs. Curling up, she could see that a ritual was in its final stages, the morbid consummation. The funeral must be in the Middle Space, off the straight avenue. Soon they would have a horrible shattering, a grandiose howl, an unconditional prostration. The crowd was small, six Others, so a prominent Other must have died. The body was already under the branches though, so Anne couldn’t quite tell. Rule number four: “The story should be set in a city. The protagonists should be seeing the city for the first time and should be impressed and dazzled by its scale.” She pulled up, too quickly, and she was once again too high. She hovered over the whole of the OSC, the Other South City, momentarily dazzled 11 . There were 24 million Others in the city, more than any city on Earth had held for 50 years, and that was without counting however many were living in the subterranean tunnels. Even at night, glowing with torches over the large avenues, the circles within interlocked circles, orbs within orbs which were so typically a figure of the Southern part of the main Continent, the City Center sprawled haphazardly. So much life. So much life to see. But all that life was none of her business. Her business was back on the lower Che­khovs. Anne flipped back to the saved locale. The Other­tribespeople were still waiting patiently for a big fish to come to light. Back in OSC, she floated over the Coil, the central avenue of the biggest Other city. The flashes of the running Others, the tumult of their flat faces. Who to follow? Who to forget? She followed one Other licking his lips anxiously. He turned off the corner and was gone. She followed another Other woman before she dipped into a store that sold texts. The universe is crammed with fascinating irrelevance. Anne was just watching now. All the work had already been done on the main streets, although it grew out of date so rapidly. When she had been a xenosociologist, she had studied some of the commercial patterns, the gift and theft matrices that seemed to be their version of exchange. That was before her department, and all the other departments except xenolinguistics, had been folded into general xenology. They were all just xenologists now. She widened her gaze and drifted into one of the neighborhoods halfway to the Uppertown Stage, or more than halfway if the city was still spreading since she had last read about it. The harsh tangerine dawn was rising on Other children as they played the string game in its labyrinthine star patterns laid out in the sand. She had written one of her first papers in grade school on geometrical erudition in Other children games, an A+. Her teacher, Ms. Norwood, had said, not quite believing it, that she might work at ISEL some day. She remembered that Ms. Norwood had been a devotee of Wodeck’s theory of distant proprioception, though it had been defunct as a theory even then. By virtue of the Heisenberg principle, Wodeck argued, we must be altering the Others in our observation of them. The idea was too Romantic for the academy or the public, both of whom thought Heisenberg was fine for electrons but not for aliens who had been dead for 1,500 years and whose remains had long since rotted to ashes by the time their light had arrived. The idea was doubly distasteful, because who knew who was watching us, and from where? Who wanted to believe their lives were shaped by alien eyes? Anne saw another Other girl, to a side of the players, reading pages, so she pushed in, focused, and caught a corner of the text, cut and pasted it into the archive comparer on the off chance it might be new and viable, a late entry into the now mostly unread library of the Other. Rule number six: “Include a pivotal scene in which a group of people escape from a building at night at high speed in a high tech vehicle made of metal and glass.” Then the book, in the middle of being copied, fluttered from the Other girl’s hands. The Other girl’s face was up, staring, in horrified confusion. Anne flicked over to where the Other child was looking. A smoldering hole had formed in the sand lot beside the children’s play space. A bizarre machine, unlike any devices she had seen in any xenology class, careened 12 at top pace down one of the lesser coils. She looked down. An Other man and an Other woman were riding in it, driving. The machine was large and silver. It would fit a bed. The thing must have ripped through the surface. She had never heard of that. She looked closer, and the Other man and the Other woman were carrying a baby, and they had a look of terror and tenderness on their haggard faces, pale from the cruelty of underground life. Anne pulled out with a curled fist, and they had no chance to escape. The restraint work of the Other authorities was always impressive in its brutality. The Others were monsters when it came to crime and punishment and angrily excised any difference with savagery. A remorseless circle of exalters, at least 30 of them, were coiling in on the fleeing Others. How long did they have? She looked back, flipped up. The Other man smiled at the Other woman for some obscure reason, cooed over the infant. She flipped back and the round group of the sinister exalters crept in, and then they all slowed, out of screen. She flipped back up and the strange machine had vanished. She curled up more. The machine had crashed into a boulder, and the Other woman with her baby were burning horribly inside the wreckage, and the Other man, thrown clear, lay dying on the gray sand. The Other man was looking straight up. He was looking straight up at Anne. He was staring at her across the galaxy right into her eye. Rule number 10: “Include extended descriptions of intense physical sensations and name the bodily organs that perceive these sensations.” The first part of that rule is generally good writing advice (make ‘em feel it), but the second part is innovative: It’s not just the description but the organs that matter. ______ Anne’s face, as it sucked out of the viewer, pulled slightly on the flaps, gently squeezing her eyeballs in their sockets 13 . Two hours and 17 minutes had passed. Time was always distorted by drifting over the Other, what with a 36 hour, 17 minute, 54 second day. Culture shock is always worse coming home. “Ed?” She called up the professor’s visuals from control. His face, on Skype, was the haggard face of a begging administrator on one call after another. “Hi Anne, did they hold up a sign saying ‘Hi, Earth’?” “I saw something.” “Is it profitable and marketable?” Was there profit in that rickety old machine somewhere? Was there some kind of profit in that? Or in the look of sadness on the Other’s face? “There’s lots of wonderful things to see, Anne. Nobody needs us here to show them a new wonderful thing. The moon shines wonderfully every evening. Nobody needs 70,000-ton telescopes in the sky to show them a place they have never seen before. If we want to keep an eye on, we have to find useful, profitable Otherness. Not the new and wonderful. Got it? ” “Got it.” “Profitable and marketable.” “Profitable and marketable.” The wreckage was still smoldering gruesomely on the viewer. The corpse of the Other man had already been cleared away. The machine, which must have been cobbled together in the underground, chuffed and spluttered smokily. And there was no way any of it could ever be profitable and marketable. Anne called Lee, a colleague from graduate school who had worked on subterranean history, and if she was recalling it right, even something with machines. He was living in Cairo these days, she thought, some kind of assistant professor at the uni there. This guy is here—this whole scene is here—because there needed to be four speaking characters and I needed more dialog. If I were just writing it myself, I would probably cut the whole section. “Is that Anne?” he asked 14 . He was older, more slovenly than she remembered, but it had been nearly 10 years. She reached him at a Shisha bar on Tahrir Square. “Is that the Anne who is working, I heard, at ISEL and who is actually looking into the sky?” “That’s me.” “And what can I do for Anne who has a good job at ISEL where she is looking into the sky?” “You once, long ago, studied the subterranea right?” Ordinarily, when I’m writing and I’m stuck with a line I don’t like, I work on finding the right way to write that line. The adjective sucks? I find a better adjective or cut the adjective altogether. But, in this case, that’s not enough. If you cut an adjective in one place, you have to put in an adjective somewhere else, and putting in that adjective somewhere else alters the balance of sentence length, paragraph length, paragraph length variation, and so on. It’s a bit like doing a Rubik’s cube. You fix one thing, you’ve messed up the side you weren’t looking at. The hitch in his voice swelled awkwardly, stringently, into a silence. The envy reached through the phone. Anne remembered. Lee had only managed a lousy archival job 15 , rustling in 10-year-old tapes for culinary elements. All the best dishes had been transferred years ago. “Wow. You’re actually at ISEL asking me a question about the subterranean, aren’t you?” “That I am.” His voice hitched again. “You didn’t see a real breakout, did you?” “Well, I’m not sure. I just want to know if there’s any history on the machines used in breakouts.” Lee paused, recognizing that his scholarship might matter, realizing that the Other existed, was existing, and he understood it, understood it usefully. “Well, a big book on subterranea as a prison system is Nguyen’s Other Underground , but that was 40 years ago or more even. The subterranea’s only had maybe a thousand hours of inspection over the past 20 years.” “Why is that?” “I guess they figure if the Others don’t care about it, why would we? People get bored with mysteries after awhile, for sure. And then there was an article a couple of years ago, out of the unit at Oxford. ‘Otherness among the Other,’ but it was general xenosociology. Wasn’t that your field?” “Before it all folded.” “Right. We’re all xenologists now. Also, there’s a footnote in my last paper in Otherism on the first escape, but you know all about that. So what can you tell me about your breakout?” She would be fired for a leak, even with Lee, even for a story no one cared to hear. Systems grow stricter as institutions decline. If there is nothing profitable or marketable in a thing, it must remain a secret or it has no value at all. Rule number five: “Part of the action should unfold at night during an intense storm.” One way of looking at this algorithm is as an editor. It’s commissioning a story with guidelines and then forcing me to write it the way it wants. If I don’t do it right, the algorithm makes me do it again, and again, until I get it right. ______ Her parents were still up when Anne, sick from the train and suffused with an indefinable and all-suffusing disappointment, rolled through the portico of the family farmstead. She found them in the viewing room, watching a new storm roll ferociously over the cornfields and the apple orchard. Mom was lying down, asleep, with her head on Dad’s lap. The lightning from the storm 16 was continuous enough that the room needed no other illumination, and Anne’s skin tingled furtively 17 with the electricity in the air. She sat beside her father in the noise of the rain that filled her ears like a cloying syrup. “How was the first day at ISEL?” he whispered. “Everything I thought it would be.” “And what did you think it would be then?” It was the first time that day that anyone had cared what Anne thought. And at that very moment she didn’t want to see or to record. At that very moment she just wanted to listen to the rain. “There’s just so much of it,” she said. “It is another world.” “And what are we doing looking at it?” “Keeping an eye on, right?” “Keeping an eye on what?” Anne’s father ran a hand through her mother’s hair a few moments. “This morning I was weighing in my mind that first book of the Other plants and animals we bought you. Remember that?” “Sure.” “And those bedroom sheets you wanted so badly, the ones with a little kangaroo-like Other thing on it. What are they called?” “Calotricks.” “And now you’re a grown-up woman, and they’re letting you look up in the sky from the big machines at ISEL.” The storm ripped the sky, harsh as a lash against her eyes. Her dad was proud of her, but she could tell he cared less for the Other world—the distant miracle, a sign however remote that we were not alone in the universe—than whether she would be able to move out now that she had a job. She was about to tell him about the nightmare chase of the burning woman and the dying man and the baby they took with them when her mother roused, and Dad shushed and began to sing: I chose the title of the story. Some things the algorithm didn’t get to decide. Did you know this poem was actually written by a person? A woman named Jane Taylor (1783–1824). And it’s so famous that everybody assumes nobody wrote it, that it just kind of appeared. That is the ultimate achievement of writing, that it’s so good that no person could have written it. How I wonder what you are. He picked up his wife and carried her out of the viewing room to bed. Anne was alone, more alone than before. “The fact that it’s really not that bad is kind of remarkable.” That’s how Rich, my human editor, described the story. I’ll take it. The exhaustion of the day accumulating inside her, she was glad of a half-dark room and a storm. As a child, to be even a cog in the celestial machinery would have been enough. She loved a whole other world, miraculously reflected in a skypiercing eye. She was middle-aged now: There was only light, moving through emptiness, trapped by machines 20 . Andy Ward, editor in chief, Random House “Topic modeling,” Hammond says of the process he and Brooke used to create the 14 rules, “is mathematically sophisticated but otherwise stupid. The algorithm looks for words that tend to occur near one another in a very large corpus of text.” Based on how frequently the words appear together, Hammond determined what my story had to be about. For instance, after finding clusters of words throughout the texts that suggested extraterrestrial worlds and beings, he gave me rule number one: “The story should be set on a planet other than Earth.” Back The algorithm affected the story much more than I thought it would. Rule number one above seemed to conflict with rule number nine: “Include a scene set on a traditional Earth farm, with apple trees and corn fields.” The only way I could figure out how to follow both rules was to have someone on Earth viewing another planet. Which, I have to say, I like—the feeling that you’re watching helplessly as faraway events transpire. That suits our time, doesn’t it? Back What most writers and readers consider style (a recognizable way with words) is not what the algorithm considers style. It was developed to analyze average sentence length, variance in paragraph length, verbs per 100 words, and dozens of other statistics and patterns that my story would have to follow. Back I wrote a rough draft, based on the rules and guidelines, and dropped it into the interface. The first thing SciFiQ told me was that I used too few adverbs. I’ve always been taught to cut anything ending in ly , and I had to go back over the story putting in adverbs. Absurdly, good science fiction has a lot of adverbs. Back It wasn’t just adverbs either.

Back The female dialog thing is still bugging me. If I had chosen a different 50 stories, or even changed one of the 50 stories, there would be a different outcome. I need to start reading better science fiction. Back Rule number 11: “Engage the sublime.

(500, 1, 'Google Is Giving Away AI That Can Build Your Genome Sequence', 'https://wired.com/story/google-is-giving-away-ai-that-can-build-your-genome-sequence', '2017-12-15 21:08:06', 'https://media.wired.com/photos/5a29cd4e15e73c599bf95401/master/pass/GoogleDNA-TAFA.jpg', 'Today, a teaspoon of spit and a hundred bucks is all you need to get a snapshot of your DNA . But getting the full picture—all 3 billion base pairs of your genome—requires a much more laborious process. One that, even with the aid of sophisticated statistics, scientists still struggle over. It’s exactly the kind of problem that makes sense to outsource to artificial intelligence . On Monday, Google released a tool called DeepVariant that uses deep learning —the machine learning technique that now dominates AI—to identify all the mutations that an individual inherits from their parents. 1 Modeled loosely on the networks of neurons in the human brain, these massive mathematical models have learned how to do things like identify faces posted to your Facebook news feed, transcribe your inane requests to Siri , and even fight internet trolls . And now, engineers at Google Brain and Verily (Alphabet’s life sciences spin-off) have taught one to take raw sequencing data and line up the billions of As, Ts, Cs, and Gs that make you you . And oh yeah, it’s more accurate than all the existing methods out there. Last year, DeepVariant took first prize in an FDA contest promoting improvements in genetic sequencing . The open source version the Google Brain/Verily team introduced to the world Monday reduced the error rates even further—by more than 50 percent. Looks like grandmaster Ke Jie isn’t be the only one getting bested by Google’s AI neural networks this year. DeepVariant arrives at a time when healthcare providers, pharma firms, and medical diagnostic manufacturers are all racing to capture as much genomic information as they can. To meet the need, Google rivals like IBM and Microsoft are all moving into the healthcare AI space, with speculation about whether Apple and Amazon will follow suit. While DeepVariant’s code comes at no cost, that isn’t true of the computing power required to run it. Scientists say that expense is going to prevent it from becoming the standard anytime soon, especially for large-scale projects. But DeepVariant is just the front end of a much wider deployment; genomics is about to go deep learning. And once you go deep learning, you don’t go back. It’s been nearly two decades since high-throughput sequencing escaped the labs and went commercial. Today, you can get your whole genome for just $1,000 (quite a steal compared to the $1.5 million it cost to sequence James Watson’s in 2008). But the data produced by today’s machines still only produce incomplete, patchy, and glitch-riddled genomes. Errors can get introduced at each step of the process, and that makes it difficult for scientists to distinguish the natural mutations that make you you from random artifacts, especially in repetitive sections of a genome. See, most modern sequencing technologies work by taking a sample of your DNA, chopping it up into millions of short snippets, and then using fluorescently-tagged nucleotides to produce reads—the list of As, Ts, Cs, and Gs that correspond to each snippet. Then those millions of reads have to be grouped into abutting sequences and aligned with a reference genome. From there they can go on to variant calling—identifying where an individual&#x27;s genes differ from the reference. 1 A number of software programs exist to help do that. FreeBayes, VarDict, Samtools, and the most well-used, GATK, depend on sophisticated statistical approaches to spot mutations and filter out errors. Each tool has strengths and weaknesses, and scientists often wind up having to use them in conjunction. No one knows the limitations of the existing technology better than Mark DePristo and Ryan Poplin. They spent five years creating GATK from whole cloth. This was 2008: no tools, no bioinformatics formats, no standards. “We didn’t even know what we were trying to compute!” says DePristo. But they had a north star: an exciting paper that had just come out, written by a Silicon Valley celebrity named Jeff Dean . As one of Google’s earliest engineers, Dean had helped design and build the fundamental computing systems that underpin the tech titan’s vast online empire. DePristo and Poplin used some of those ideas to build GATK, which became the field’s gold standard. But by 2013, the work had plateaued. “We tried almost every standard statistical approach under the sun, but we never found an effective way to move the needle,” says DePristo. “It was unclear after five years whether it was even possible to do better.” DePristo left to pursue a Google Ventures-backed start-up called SynapDx that was developing a blood test for autism. When that folded two years later, one of its board members, Andrew Conrad (of Google X, then Google Life Sciences, then Verily) convinced DePristo to join the Google/Alphabet fold. He was reunited with Poplin, who had joined up the month before. And this time, Dean wasn’t just a citation; he was their boss. As the head of Google Brain, Dean is the man behind the explosion of neural nets that now prop up all the ways you search and tweet and snap and shop. With his help, DePristo and Poplin wanted to see if they could teach one of these neural nets to piece together a genome more accurately than their baby, GATK. The network wasted no time in making them feel obsolete. After training it on benchmark datasets of just seven human genomes, DeepVariant was able to accurately identify those single nucleotide swaps 99.9587 percent of the time. “It was shocking to see how fast the deep learning models outperformed our old tools,” says DePristo. Their team submitted the results to the PrecisionFDA Truth Challenge last summer, where it won a top performance award. In December, they shared them in a paper published on bioRxiv . DeepVariant works by transforming the task of variant calling—figuring out which base pairs actually belong to you and not to an error or other processing artifact—into an image classification problem. It takes layers of data and turns them into channels, like the colors on your television set. In the first working model they used three channels: The first was the actual bases, the second was a quality score defined by the sequencer the reads came off of, the third contained other metadata. By compressing all that data into an image file of sorts, and training the model on tens of millions of these multi-channel “images,” DeepVariant began to be able to figure out the likelihood that any given A or T or C or G either matched the reference genome completely, varied by one copy, or varied by both. But they didn’t stop there. After the FDA contest they transitioned the model to TensorFlow , Google&#x27;s artificial intelligence engine, and continued tweaking its parameters by changing the three compressed data channels into seven raw data channels. That allowed them to reduce the error rate by a further 50 percent. In an independent analysis conducted this week by genomics computing platform, DNAnexus, DeepVariant vastly outperformed GATK, Freebayes, and Samtools, sometimes reducing errors by as much as 10-fold. “That shows that this technology really has an important future in the processing of bioinformatic data,” says DNAnexus CEO, Richard Daly. “But it’s only the opening chapter in a book that has 100 chapters.” Daly says he expects this kind of AI to one day actually find the mutations that cause disease. His company received a beta version of DeepVariant, and is now testing the current model with a limited number of its clients—including pharma firms, big health care providers, and medical diagnostic companies. To run DeepVariant effectively for these customers, DNAnexus has had to invest in newer generation GPUs to support its platform. The same is true for Canadian competitor, DNAStack, which plans to offer two different versions of DeepVariant—one tuned for low cost and one tuned for speed. Google’s Cloud Platform already supports the tool, and the company is exploring using the TPUs (tensor processing units) that connect things like Google Search, Street View, and Translate to accelerate the genomics calculations as well. DeepVariant’s code is open-source so anyone can run it, but to do so at scale will likely require paying for a cloud computing platform. And it’s this cost—computationally and in terms of actual dollars—that have researchers hedging on DeepVariant’s utility. “It’s a promising first step, but it isn’t currently scalable to a very large number of samples because it’s just too computationally expensive,” says Daniel MacArthur, a Broad/Harvard human geneticist who has built one of the largest libraries of human DNA to date. For projects like his, which deal in tens of thousands of genomes, DeepVariant is just too costly. And, just like current statistical models, it can only work with the limited reads produced by today’s sequencers. Still, he thinks deep learning is here to stay. “It’s just a matter of figuring out how to combine better quality data with better algorithms and eventually we’ll converge on something pretty close to perfect,” says MacArthur. But even then, it’ll still just be a list of letters. At least for the foreseeable future, we’ll still need talented humans to tell us what it all means. 1 Correction 12/12/17 4:28pm EST An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to what DeepVariant does as &quot;assembling genomes.&quot; The tool calls variants, which is an important part of the genotyping process, but one not involved in genome assembly.

First, they wanted to create an AI system that can spawn new AI systems, which are more sophisticated than what humans can design. Second, they wanted to test this system to identify objects in real time with remarkable accuracy. They&#x2019;ve done both&#x2013;and their research has vast implications for everything from surveillance to self-driving cars. Designing machine learning models is remarkably tedious. It requires significant time and expertise, so to speed things up, Google&#x2019;s researchers created AutoML,&#xA0; a machine learning model designed to create other machine learning models using an approach called reinforcement learning . This method has a controller neural network that can create a &#x201C;child&#x201D; network to execute a specific task. In this case, the task was to recognize objects in a real-time video feed, like people, cars, traffic lights, handbags, or backpacks. The &#x201C;child&#x201D; model trains for the task and gets evaluated by the controller AI, which learns from the feedback and refines the child&#x2013;a process that gets repeated thousands of times until the child model gets really good. [Image: Barret Zoph, Vijay Vasudevan, Jonathon Shlens, and Quoc V. Le./ Arxiv ] How good? The Google Brain researchers claim that their machine-designed model beats all state-of-the-art computer vision systems created by people. They applied AutoML to the ImageNet image classification and COCO object detection data set, which according to the Google team are &#x201C;two of the most respected large-scale academic data sets in computer vision.&#x201D; This graphic shows the accuracy of their system&#x2013;called NASNet&#x2013;in red: [Image: Google Research Blog ] Not only is NASNet vastly more accurate, it&#x2019;s more efficient than other models. According to the researchers&#x2019; article, it halves &#x201C;the computational cost of the best reported result on arxiv.org (SENet). &#x201D; Self-driving cars are one obvious use of this architecture. You can imagine the system helping Google&#x2019;s AVs identify traffic, pedestrians, and road hazards. NASNet could also be used in augmented reality to help apps interact with the environment in a faster, more accurate way that current computer vision solutions. But perhaps the most intriguing applications have yet to be identified. Google&#x2019;s researchers decided to make NASNet public here (for image classification) and here (for object detection) , so other scientists can make use of it. Of course, automating automation raises some alarming questions. How do&#xA0; you ensure you aren&#x2019;t building a biased system that then passes that bias onto another system? How do you ensure the systems are used ethically? I can imagine some dystopian applications, like&#xA0;automated surveillance, in which computers constantly analyze images to flag objects or activities that they consider suspicious. That could be a boon to public safety or it could be the makings of a police state. I can also imagine refining the system to recognize faces on the fly and follow anyone across a city. NASNet can address &#x201C;multitudes of computer vision problems we have not yet imagined,&#x201D; the researchers write. For better or for worse .', 0, 0, 5, 1);

Further photo and video analysis since, though, indicate that the missile test represents an even greater advance in capabilities than analysts first thought. And as the international community grapples with the geopolitical implications, more North Korean missile sophistication means more tough questions for the country&#x27;s enemies. Many analysts originally assumed that North Korea this week launched an improved version of a Hwasong-14 missile, the ICBM the country successfully tested twice in July . But North Korean photos and video show that while the rocket tested on Tuesday is a two-stage, liquid-fueled missile that has some similar features to the Hwasong-14, the latest effort is significantly larger, and has a first stage powered by two engines instead of one. The second stage also seems to have more propellant than the Hwasong-14. A bigger and more powerful rocket can carry a heavier load farther, so analysts note that the new missile, dubbed the Hwasong-15, can likely carry a North Korean warhead as far as Kim Jong-un could want—including anywhere in the continental US. The North Korean government claimed in a television broadcast that the Hwasong-15 has &quot;much greater advantages in its tactical and technological specifications and technical characteristics.” &quot;I’m not surprised that they eventually tested something like they did on Tuesday, I just thought they would try to better understand the Hwasong-14 and then move,&quot; says Michael Elleman, a senior fellow for missile defense at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and an analyst for the North Korean watchdog group 38 North. &quot;Now they’ve just stepped straight up into the Hwasong-15.&quot; The new missile can likely carry a North Korean warhead as far as Kim Jong-un could want—including anywhere in the continental US. In the last two years, as Kim Jong-un dramatically ramped up North Korea&#x27;s ICBM development and testing, the country has been gradually surmounting the list of technological challenges that were keeping it from becoming a full fledged nuclear power. It showed that it could adequately miniaturize a warhead, worked on liquid versus solid fueling issues, flew two missiles over Japan , and conducted its sixth—and most powerful— nuclear bomb test yet at the beginning of September. The country has certainly had launch failures, including a series of misfires with the Musudan, or Hwasong-10, missiles in 2016, and another in April . But with a number of recent launches going relatively smoothly, the program&#x27;s momentum has increased. &quot;While I don’t have definitive proof, all the evidence points to North Korea having imported key hardware specifically the engines,&quot; 38 North&#x27;s Elleman says. &quot;That is a major source of failures at the beginning of a program, and they’ve basically acquired flight-proven hardware in the engines. It’s quite impressive even with imported hardware, but I think this is what has allowed them to move forward so quickly and not experience failed tests.&quot; North Korea has also continued work on its submarine-launched ballistic missile program, according to new analysis on Friday, also from 38 North. Satellite images show that the country is preparing to deploy one of its submersible test stand barges, presumably to work on or conduct an underwater ICBM launch. The country also continues to produce fissile material for its weapons. North Korea&#x27;s impending status as a full nuclear power has created increasing international tension and unease. The US has always had limited options in dealing with the Hermit Kingdom, but getting North Korea to agree to a weapons development freeze is no longer one of them. Defense Secretary James Mattis said on Thursday that he is still focused on diplomatic negotiations. “I am not willing to say that diplomacy has not worked. We will continue to work diplomatically,&quot; Mattis said. &quot;At the same time, our diplomats will speak from a position of strength because we do have military options.” The country is likely much less focused on perfection than nations like the US, Russia, and China. North Korea remains unlikely to actually strike the US with a nuclear missile, given the undoubtably severe response such an attack would provoke. Analysts generally view North Korea&#x27;s nuclear ambitions as an avenue to gain leverage in negotiations on the world stage, a deterrent against attacks, and a safeguard against any international efforts to undermine the current regime. The Trump administration&#x27;s volatile rhetoric on North Korea, though, particularly from the President himself , has led to fears that now any small incident or miscalculation could escalate into a larger crisis. &quot;At this point we’re into this mode where we have to be worried about deterrence functioning stably,&quot; says Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute for International Studies in Monterey, California. &quot;We want to make sure that there’s no possibility of an accident or a misperception or a miscalculation, and so we’re in this very difficult situation.&quot; Experts say that some technical challenges still remain for the country as well. The country&#x27;s reentry vehicles are essentially untested in real-world conditions, the precision missile targeting systems are probably still questionable, and North Korean engineers will now need to work on the reliability of the system as a whole so it can function at a moment&#x27;s notice. But all of those objectives are attainable, given what North Korea has shown so far. And don&#x27;t forget—the country is likely much less focused on perfection than nations like the US, Russia, and China. &quot;What normally happens in other countries is after you’ve got four or five tests under your belt, you start doing tests under a variety of conditions and that usually takes a dozen to two dozen flight tests. But North Korea can probably live with ‘it succeeds more often than it fails,’&quot; 38 North&#x27;s Elleman says. &quot;So my bottom line is that three or four more tests, if they’re successful and they fly them on a fairly normal trajectory, North Korea would likely move ahead, deploy the systems, declare them combat ready and then, yeah, grab a beer.&quot; CNMN Collection Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our user agreement (effective 3/21/12) and privacy policy (effective 3/21/12).

Like something strange has been walking and rolling among us? Like we’re now sharing the planet with a new species of our own creation? Well, we are, because 2017 was the year that the robots really, truly arrived. They escaped the factory floor and started conquering big cities to deliver Mediterranean food . Self-driving cars swarmed the streets . And even bipedal robots—finally capable of not immediately falling on their faces— strolled out of the lab and into the real world. The machines are here, and it’s an exhilarating time indeed. Like, now Atlas the humanoid robot can do backflips . Backflips . “2017 has been an amazing year for robotics,” says roboticist Sebastian Thrun, a pioneer of the self-driving car. “Why 2017? Why did it take us so long?” Well, it was a confluence of factors, namely the cheapening of sophisticated hardware combined with better brains. “In the past, in robotics we had not-so-smart software with hardware that would break all the time, and that&#x27;s not a good product,&quot; Thrun says. &quot;It&#x27;s only recently that both computers have become smart enough and that robot hardware has become reliable enough that the very first products start to emerge.” Perhaps the biggest leap in hardware has been sensor technology. To build a robot you don’t have to babysit, you need it to sense its environment, and to sense its environment it needs a range of sensors. Not just with cameras, but with lasers that build a 3-D map of the robot’s surroundings. These kinds of components have gotten both far more powerful and far cheaper. “I kind of talk about this finally being the golden age of robotics, and that means that for the first time in the last 12 months or so you see robots really becoming prolific,” says Ben Wolff, CEO of Sarcos Robotics, which makes the most bonkers robot arms you’ve ever seen . “And I think it&#x27;s because we&#x27;re finally at that crossover point, where the cost has come down of components while the capability of the components has increased sufficiently.” Like, come down big time. One sensor cost Sarcos a quarter of a million dollars in 2010. Today, it’s $8,000—that’d be 3 percent of the cost just seven years ago. Other components like actuators—the motors in the joints of something like a robot arm—are also falling steadily in cost. Today, an actuator that once cost $3,500 is closer to $1,500. And it&#x27;s actuators, perhaps more than any other component, that promise to take robotics to the next level in the very near future. Loaded with cheaper, supercharged sensors, robots are finally capable of tackling the uncertainty of the human world. Whether humans actually want that is another question. Take delivery robots, for instance. In San Francisco’s chaotic Mission neighborhood this year, a robot called Marble began picking up food and delivering it straight to customers’ doors. Yet it’s not navigating the relatively structured streets—with lanes and stop signs and such—but sidewalks. That means it has to dodge pedestrians and buskers and discarded furniture, then still be able to cross the street and deal with cars. It ain’t perfect, which is why a human handler follows the robot to remote-control it when it gets in trouble (when WIRED got a demo in April, it nearly ran down a dog ). That safeguard wasn&#x27;t enough for the SF Board of Supervisors, which earlier this month voted to severely restrict the operation of the machines . Regulations aside, robotics are only set to encroach further on human spaces. “In the past we had robots that were novelty,” says Wolff. “We certainly had robots that could do repetitive tasks bolted to the floor for years and years. But what&#x27;s changed is we&#x27;re now talking about robots that are mobile in nature.” Much of that has to do with the robots’ bigger brains. It takes a whole lot of processing power for a robot to eyeball a person and navigate around them, while at the same keeping on its trajectory and avoiding other humans. Luckily, better chips mean all of these calculations can now happen aboard the machine, as opposed to giant computers doing the processing in the cloud. Specifically, the smartphone revolution has helped shrink down processors while making them burlier and cheaper and more energy-efficient. Perfect for little robots like Kuri . So where do we go from here? And I do mean we . Our human brains tend to anthropomorphize anything that remotely seems like an intelligent agent, so it&#x27;s tempting to form bonds with the machines, especially when they’re “cute” and “lovable.” I mean, back in August it happened to me: I told a robot I loved it just to get its attention . Those human-robot relationships are primed for ethical upsets. Imagine a child forming a bond with a highly intelligent doll. At some point, the manufacturer might exploit that relationship by having the doll ask the kid if they want an over-the-air update that’d make the robot even more fun—for the low, low price of $49.99. It’s early, I know—I just got through saying the robots have arrived. But as someone who’s experienced the surprising psychological draw of robots, I want to make this clear: The robot-human relationship is bizarre and fraught with potential misadventures . Better to think of this now than have a doll suddenly bilking you out of money.

Today in Science Robotics , researchers from the University of Tokyo show off a humanoid that is strikingly lifelike not just in how it looks, but how it moves. The machine is a radical departure from the stiff, bumbling humanoids that have so far done a whole lot of falling on their faces . (Props to Boston Dynamics’ latest iteration of Atlas, though, which can do backflips now .) Kengoro is its name, and badminton is its game, even though it’s not super great at it. Oh, also, it can sweat. The idea with Kengoro, and its older iteration Kenshiro, is to replicate the human body as closely as possible. The researchers modeled Kenshiro after a 13-year-old male, so it weighs in at 115 pounds. Kengoro is slightly heavier. And the ratio of things like foot length and shoulder height to human figures are all almost exact for both robots. Let’s focus on Kengoro though, since it’s more newfangled. Your typical humanoid robot moves thanks to actuators—a fancy name for a motor combined with a gearbox —in its joints. Very inhuman. Kengoro’s 116 actuators instead pull on wires that mimic the contraction of human muscles. These &quot;muscles&quot; are even arranged like they are in the human body (though the analog of the human calf muscle is made of two actuators to produce enough force). Think of it like the world’s most advanced marionette. Actuators, though, inevitably produce heat, in Kengoro or any other robot. So Kengoro sweats. Water circulates through its metal frame, which is made of a special porous aluminum. This allows the heated water to escape as vapor, thus releasing heat from the motors . As an added bonus, that aluminum gives the robot a sturdy frame. But Kengoro is also extremely flexible, with six times the degrees of freedom as traditional humanoids. It can move its head from side to side like it&#x27;s cracking its neck. It can even stand on its tippy toes. That’s all thanks to those &quot;muscles,&quot; in contrast to just a handful of motors powering the joints of a more traditional humanoid. Also, Kengoro has a flexible spine. That’s why it can do sit-ups that look like human sit-ups. Try getting a traditional humanoid to do this and it’ll fold more like a Lego minifigure. Kengoro, though, does lose out on the rigidity of its Lego-esque comrades. Boston Dynamics’ Atlas can do backflips because it doesn’t crumple when it lands. Still, Kengoro is no weakling—it can lift its own body weight in a pull-up. So this bot is a bit more loosey-goosey, fine. But its lower-power profile means it can afford to slim down to more accurately mimic a human. That could be useful for a number of reasons, not all of which Kengoro will want to hear. For one, you could turn it into a very useful crash dummy. Modern dummies are packed with sophisticated sensors, sure, but they’re still passive. Meaning, Kengoro could get in there and better simulate how a real live human body responds to a crash. The cost of the robot would have to come way down for that to be feasible, though. In the nearer term, the robot could inform the design of robotic limbs. And while humanoids seem silly right now, they’re only going to get more sophisticated. Less … face-planty. At some point, they may come in handy as rescue robots, navigating environments other machines can’t. After all, humans built this world for humans. To make sense of, say, a melted-down nuclear facility, it’s probably best if you have legs to climb stairs and hands to turn valves. For now, though, it’s push-ups and back extensions for Kengoro.

The factory would cater directly to the European market, with digital designs that could be tweaked ad infinitum and robots that could seamlessly transmute them into footwear customized to the shifting preferences of Continental sneakerheads.
