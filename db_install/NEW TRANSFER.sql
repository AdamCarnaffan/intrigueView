Login credentials of more than half a million records belonging to vehicle tracking device company SVR Tracking have leaked online, potentially exposing the personal data and vehicle details of drivers and businesses using its service. Just two days ago, Viacom was found exposing the keys to its kingdom on an unsecured Amazon S3 server, and this data breach is yet another example of storing sensitive data on a misconfigured cloud server. The Kromtech Security Center was first to discover a wide-open, public-facing misconfigured Amazon Web Server (AWS) S3 cloud storage bucket containing a cache belonging to SVR that was left publicly accessible for an unknown period. Stands for Stolen Vehicle Records, the SVR Tracking service allows its customers to track their vehicles in real time by attaching a physical tracking device to vehicles in a discreet location, so their customers can monitor and recover them in case their vehicles are stolen. The leaked cache contained details of roughly 540,000 SVR accounts, including email addresses and passwords, as well as users\' vehicle data, like VIN (vehicle identification number), IMEI numbers of GPS devices. Since the leaked passwords were stored using SHA-1, a 20-years-old weak cryptographic hash function that was designed by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which can be cracked with ease. The leaked database also exposed 339 logs that contained photographs and data about vehicle status and maintenance records, along with a document with information on the 427 dealerships that use SVR\'s tracking services. Interestingly, the exposed database also contained information where exactly in the car the physical tracking unit was hidden. According to Kromtech, the total number of devices exposed \"could be much larger given the fact that many of the resellers or clients had large numbers of devices for tracking.\" Since SVR\'s car tracking device monitors a vehicle everywhere for the past 120 days, anyone with access to SVR users\' login credentials could both track a vehicle in real time and create a detailed log of every location the vehicle has visited using any internet connected device like a desktop, laptop, mobile phone or tablet. Eventually, the attacker could outright steal the vehicle or even rob a home when they know a car\'s owner is out. Kromtech responsible alerted the company of the misconfigured AWS S3 cloud storage bucket, which has since been secured. However, It is unclear whether the publically accessible data was possibly accessed by hackers or not. function aaFunction(){var n=document.getElementById(\"aim18502387354535050289\"),e=document.getElementById(\"aim28502387354535050289\"),s=document.getElementById(\"aim38502387354535050289\"),r=e.innerHTML,t=r.search(/\\x3C!-- adsense --\\x3E/gim);if(t>0){n.innerHTML=r.substr(0,t);var i=e.innerHTML=r.substr(t+16),a=i.search(/\\x3C!-- linkads --\\x3E/gim);if(a>0)e.innerHTML=i.substr(0,a),s.innerHTML=i.substr(a+16);else{var u=i.length,m=u/2,b=i.substr(0,m),c=i.substr(m),d=c.search(\" \"),H=c.substr(0,d),L=c.substr(d);e.innerHTML=b+H,s.innerHTML=L}}}aaFunction(); Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Home &#8250; Hacking News Swati Khandelwal Technical Writer, Security Blogger and IT Analyst.

But as with any sweeping reform, the progress also comes with some new opportunities for fraud. And phishers are loving HTTPS. On Tuesday, the phishing research and defense firm PhishLabs published new analysis showing that phishers have been adopting HTTPS more and more often on their sites. When you get a phishing email or text, the sites they lead to—that try to trick you into entering credentials, personal information, and so on—implement web encryption about 24 percent of the time now, PhishLabs found. That&#x27;s up from less than three percent at this time last year, and less than one percent two years ago. Some phishing sites come by HTTPS only incidentally, or as an added bonus. Phishers often hijack legitimate sites for their own uses, so the more HTTPS is deployed around the web overall, the more likely a that a phisher might compromise a site that implements it. But PhishLabs notes that phishers create their own sites almost as often as they steal those of others. In those cases, phishers actively chose to implement web encryption. The green padlock lends legitimacy, a patina of security that helps trick web users into trusting a site and giving up their valuable information. &quot;In two extremely prevalent types of phishes targeting PayPal and Apple, about 75 percent were using HTTPS sites,&quot; says Crane Hassold, a threat intelligence manager at PhishLabs who worked on the research. &quot;The attackers are making that choice even though this is not needed to complete the crime.&quot; Other researchers see the trend as well. During a 24-hour period this month, the anti-phishing firm PhishMe observed and analyzed over 200 examples of phishing pages that were using HTTPS. &quot;The HTTPS connection ensures that the data is encrypted when it is transmitted, but forged pages that falsely replicate an organization send the information to a criminal instead of the legitimate organizations,&quot; says Brendan Griffin, a threat intelligence manager and malware analyst at PhishMe. Web giants like Google have led a big push over the last few years to promote and even require HTTPS. And the non-profit Internet Security Research Group has been offering free verification certificates, which a site need for HTTPS to work, through its Let&#x27;s Encrypt initiative since last year. Let&#x27;s Encrypt, which is known as a &quot;certificate authority&quot; because it verifies web servers to implement encryption, has now issued more than 100 million certificates. &#x27;The fact that they&#x27;re taking a little bit of extra time to do it means it’s worthwhile to them.&#x27; These collective efforts have been paying off. In April 2016, 42 percent of page loads on the Firefox browser were to encrypted sites. In January the number hit 50 percent, and it&#x27;s now up to an impressive 67 percent. But advocates have long known that the privacy and security gains would come with some detrimental side effects. &quot;HTTPS is taking off at a rate that I think is really unprecedented for any change on the web,&quot; says Josh Aas, the executive director of ISRG. &quot;The whole web becoming encrypted is really, really good for people. And of course the bad guys are going to follow along down that trend, that’s to be expected, but in the overall picture the situation is much better than it was.&quot; Certificate authorities like ISRG argue that their scope is too limited to meaningfully police the web. They don&#x27;t have the resources, means, or opportunity to screen sites for attacks like phishing or malware. Besides, a site often won&#x27;t have any content on it at all yet when a domain owner requests an encryption certificate. And even if certificate authorities did have the resources and expertise to make content-based decisions, they don&#x27;t have the ability to really penalize sites. Revoking an HTTPS certificate doesn&#x27;t take a site down or remove abusive content. PhishLabs&#x27; Hassold notes also that the real problem anyway isn&#x27;t phishers getting a certificate and implementing HTTPS; it&#x27;s the green padlock they gain that then gives consumers a false sense of security. Where the padlock simply indicates that traffic between the server and the user&#x27;s browser is encrypted and protected against interception, consumers often assume that a green padlock means that the site is more generally secure. &quot;The messaging from the security community has been so mixed that a lot of internet users believe that a green padlock means a site is safe and legitimate when it actually doesn’t,&quot; Hassold says. &quot;So that’s why we’re seeing the big explosion of HTTPS phish. The phishers don’t have to get an SSL certificate, but the fact that they&#x27;re taking a little bit of extra time to do it means it’s worthwhile to them.&quot; And though the green padlock has essentially been the mascot of the HTTPS movement over the last few years, Aas agrees that it&#x27;s too reductive. &quot;The problem with the green lock is that it really over-promises,&quot; he says. &quot;I don’t think that browsers should be showing the green lock when a webpage is merely encrypted with HTTPS. I think it’s misleading and inappropriate. What I would rather is when a website has HTTPS you should see nothing, and without HTTPS your browser should indicate that there’s a problem. You have to replace the carrot with a stick.&quot; For the average internet user, the important thing is still following the basic steps to avoid being drawn in by phishing schemes . And don&#x27;t assume that any page that has HTTPS contains legitimate and authentic content. It&#x27;s a green padlock, not a silver bullet.

These simple math tricks can help you perform calculations more quickly and easily. They also come in handy if you want to impress your teacher, parents, or friends. If you multiply 6 by an even number, the answer will end with the same digit. The number in the tens place will be half of the number in the ones place. Example : 6 x 4 &#61; 24 The answer is 2. The answer is 37. The answer is the three digit number Examples : 371371 gives you 371 or 552552 gives you 552. The result will be a six digit number that repeats the three digit number. Example : 456 becomes 456456. This is a quick way to multiply two digit numbers by 11 in your head. Examples : 72 x 11 &#61; 792 57 x 11 &#61; 5 _ 7, but 5 &#43; 7 &#61; 12, so put 2 in the space and add the 1 to the 5 to get 627 To remember the first seven digits of pi , count the number of letters in each word of the sentence: &#34;How I wish I could calculate pi.&#34; This gives 3.141592 The number will contain the digits 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8.  Example : The number 6 yields the answer 714285.

The same goes for Uber&#x2019;s AI that books you a ride. The Danish computer scientist helped build the machine learning platforms that both companies use throughout their operations, from the engineering to the marketing departments. Lange has just done the same at video game platform maker Unity, with the goal of evolving robo characters into more complex and nuanced playing companions than a human could program. Lange doesn&#x2019;t shy away from the oft-hyped term &#x201C;artificial intelligence&#x201D;&#x2014; provided the machines really do learn how to respond to users&#x2019; needs. But he&#x2019;s skeptical of prospects for so-called artificial general intelligence, or AGI&#x2014;the Westworld -style vision of a synthetic consciousness. Lange has equally strong views on what does not count as intelligent, such as Alexa and Siri, which follow scripts written by humans, rather than thinking for themselves. Lange should know: He lead the design GM&#x2019;s OnStar, the first widespread computerized assistant, way back in the late 1990s. Fast Company spoke with Lange about nuances between real and phony AI, misunderstandings in pop culture, and the prospect of a robot uprising. He also described emerging technologies such as adversarial networks&#x2014;a battle of wits between AIs that forces each to get smarter. What follows are highlights from a longer conversation. Fast Company: Can you define artificial intelligence? Is it even definable? Danny Lange: To me, there are two key aspects. One is external, and one is internal. So the external one is really in the perception. Does the system seem to be very reasonable? Does it almost seem like there&#x2019;s a human hiding behind the system, interacting with me and making me feel comfortable? That doesn&#x2019;t have to be voice. It can also just be going to an Amazon web page and shopping around. But I get this sense that the system knows a lot about what I want and helps me get the thing that I want. The other side is the internal thing. This is where I think a disruption is under way. And that is the move . . . to systems that learn instead of being programmed. And because they learn from the data, they are able to capture much more nuanced patterns in our data than any programmer can ever do. When that comes together, I feel that we are crossing a line, and we start dealing with something that is truly AI. FC: So, truly AI. Are we talking something like general intelligence? DL: No. I think general intelligence is more of a philosophical discussion . . . I don&#x2019;t know what exactly self-awareness is and conscious is . . . I don&#x2019;t think the system is really reasoning to that extent. But it is still able to learn from the interaction and improve over time as more and more interactions take place. FC: Is the term &#x201C;AI&#x201D; being used too broadly? I know some people don&#x2019;t like, for example, using the term &#x201C;artificial intelligence&#x201D; to refer to machine learning. DL: I think that the term has become more of a broad, almost marketing-driven term. And I&#x2019;m probably okay with that. What matters is what people think of when they hear this. They think of systems that give people&#x2014;the customer or the owner of the robot or whatever&#x2014;the sense that this thing does have some kind of intelligence in its behavior, and it has the learning capability. I [can&#x2019;t] think of an AI system that doesn&#x2019;t have machine learning at its core. FC: So is a system that reads CT scans or an MRI, looking for a tumor, is that AI? DL: If it [learned from examples] hand-curated or hand-labeled by doctors, so doctors basically interpret it, that&#x2019;s definitely not AI. It&#x2019;s using machine learning technology, but they are missing the point by inserting human expertise into the loop. Because now we&#x2019;re sort of back to human programming of the system . . . AI would have been giving the computer treatment data and results, [allowing it to] start developing an ability to do the diagnosis, propose some suggestions for treatment, measure the output of the treatment, and constantly adjust and learn. FC: What are the other buzzword concepts that we should be thinking about beyond AI/ML? DL: An adversarial network is a key. So for instance, I may build a machine learning system that detects a fake product review or detects fake news. But I could also have a machine learning system that learns to generate a fake product review or fake news . . . As one of them gets better at detecting fake news, the opponent gets better at generating fake news, because it learns from the feedback loop. FC: When I mention to friends that I&#x2019;m writing something about AI, they often make a joke about computers taking over the world and killing us. Is that a legitimate fear? DL: Maybe five, 10 years ago, I often used this scary but realistic scenario. [First] you have a drone [that] a machine learning system has learned to fly on its own. And nowadays we do have those. Secondly, you equip that drone with a high-definition camera, and you put computer vision with face-recognition software in there. It will recognize &#x201C;bad people&#x201D;&#x2014;people you don&#x2019;t like, people in places they are not supposed to be. Then thirdly, you equip that thing with the ability to eliminate those people. Is it feasible? Yep. So, that&#x2019;s not really a distant future. You could do that today . . . FC: I understand that a machine could kill people. But will a machine want to kill people? That seems to go back to that philosophical notion of consciousness. DL: From a strict technical perspective, we always look for the rewards function that drives the machine . . . The rewards function in an Amazon system is, get the customer to click the purchase button. At Netflix, it&#x2019;s get the customer to click on one of our TV shows.&#xA0;What is the rewards function of a drone? Find the bad guys and eliminate them . . . It&#x2019;s really what you define as the end goal of the system [that matters]. FC: So if you don&#x2019;t define it properly, you can have some unintended consequences? DL: Yeah. FC: I know a lot of people started freaking out when the two Facebook bots began to speak to each other in their own invented language . Is that as scary as some people thought it was? DL: It&#x2019;s not scary. It&#x2019;s just that you have two learning systems. We have to get used to this. For years and years, for decades, moms and dads told their kids that computers can only do what they&#x2019;re programmed to do. And they were wrong, because now the computers can learn. They can now change that behavior. In that case of communication between computers, if the rewards function is to optimize the computer&#x2019;s ability to communicate with each other, they will probably change the language over time to optimize the communication&#x2014;using fewer letters, using better confirmation on [whether they] agree or disagree, things like that. FC: Are there things you hear people say&#x2014;whether it&#x2019;s the general public or marketing people&#x2014;that make you cringe? DL: I think a lot about the voice systems like Siri and Alexa. They&#x2019;re more like branded, hardwired systems, built to give you a safe voice interaction with their corporate owners&#x2026; All Siri&#x2019;s jokes are written by creative writers in Cupertino&#x2014;nothing that Siri learned. You&#x2019;re aware of this famous example where Microsoft launched a chatbot [named Tay] that actually learned from human interaction, yeah? It got pretty nasty. If you are a big major brand, like Apple, Google, or Amazon, you can&#x2019;t have that. So that&#x2019;s why these systems are highly branded experiences, which apparently people really like, and that&#x2019;s fine. But they are not AI. FC: Anything else that you see as common misunderstandings? DL: We are often focused on the risks and the problems, but there are also pretty impressive things in the area of using, say, computer vision to equip systems with the ability to see things. I saw an example of a system on a tractor that would look for weed in a field and basically, with an adjustable nozzle, spray Roundup on the weed only and not on your vegetables. So there are a lot of these technologies that can make our world greener, more sustainable. And sometimes there&#x2019;s an overly strong bias on how these things are going to make our lives harder going forward. Related: How To Stop Worrying And Love The Great AI War Of 2018&#xA0; FC: Anything else you think we need to know about AI? DL: The key message is, you have a learning system, and that&#x2019;s the disruption . . . Your computer can do more than it&#x2019;s told to do because it gets the data and it learns from it, and the loop makes it improve endlessly.', 0, 0, 5, 1),

And that means making the most powerful rocket ever. NASA gave photographer Vincent Fournier exclusive access to the testing and preparations for the mission, and our photographer spent 20 days at five facilities to capture how engineers build and test (and test, and test) the unprecedentedly large rocket and its human-carrying capsule. Engineers model everything from the orientation of rocket parts during transit to the way engine vibrations affect other components of the launch system. They’re building teeny models of the rocket and sticking them in wind tunnels; enlarging the agency’s trusty barge Pegasus to ferry massive hunks of metal from NASA’s Michoud facility in Louisiana to Stennis Space Center in Mississippi and finally to Kennedy Space Center in Florida; and testing the fuel tanks by using hydraulic cylinders that apply millions of pounds of crushing forces to mimic launch and flight. “You know ‘measure twice, cut once’?” says Andy Schorr, a manager of the rocket’s payload integration at NASA. “We take that to a whole new level.” Here’s what goes on before the rocket goes up. Fuel tank dome, Michoud Assembly Facility, Louisiana (Above): NASA is assembling most of the core stage of the rocket using a technique called friction stir welding: Cylinders of metal rotate between aluminum slabs, heating them to a butter like consistency. The metal sections then meld together without any cracks or contaminants. After sanding the joins by hand, technicians scan them for defects using ultrasound and X-rays. Hydrogen fuel tank, Michoud Assembly Facility: The 130-foot-tall hydrogen fuel tank for the rocket is so unwieldy and delicate that moving it from a horizontal to a vertical position (or vice versa) requires three days, two GPS-enabled cranes, and a laser alignment system to position the hardware. The man in the chair? He’s there to push the emergency Stop button. Just in case. Launch vehicle stage adapter, Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama: A pair of NASA technicians will spend three months hand-spraying insulation onto this 28-foot-tall adapter, which connects the core stage to the capsule stage. They’ve practiced for hundreds of hours on more than 50 test sprays so they can achieve a perfectly even layer every time. The polyurethane foam is whitish when it’s sprayed but turns iconic rocket orange when exposed to UV light at liftoff. I&#8217;m sorry; your browser does not support HTML5 video in WebM with VP8 or MP4 with H.264. Dome weld tool, Michoud Assembly Facility, Louisiana: To ensure a perfectly welded fuel tank dome, a crew of six takes a day or two just to clamp all the hardware in place on this Circumferential Dome Weld Tool. The blue bars align the two sections of the dome, and after the weld is complete, the crew uses an elaborate ceiling-mounted pulley system to lift the dome off the tool. RS-25 engines, Stennis Space Center, Mississippi: Four of these engines will make the SLS go; they can withstand temperatures from –423° F (the fuel stored in the tanks) to 6,000° F (the fuel at ignition). A contractor has updated them to produce a combined 2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, and engineers have recently finished modeling the acoustics around the bell-shaped nozzles to ensure they can tolerate those bone-rattling vibration patterns. Intertank, Michoud Assembly Facility, Louisiana: The rocket’s two unprecedentedly powerful boosters attach to the intertank, the core stage’s sturdiest part. It’s too thick to weld together, so instead the intertank is constructed from 7,500 bolts and eight panels, whose holes have been oh-so-carefully aligned with an assembly jig (the scaffolding) and inspected with X-rays. After it&#8217;s constructed, NASA stress-tests it with more than 100 hydraulic actuators, some as heavy as cars. Systems Integration Test Facility, Marshall Space Flight Center: Five miles of riotous wiring connects 46 avionics boxes, which control everything from navigation to the engines. Each box is tested in thermal chambers and on very large shake tables to see how they hold up to extreme heat, cold, and vibration. Then they’re all hooked together on these racks—curved to mimic the rocket—to run full launch simulations. Systems Integration Test Facility, Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama: The outer surface of these avionics racks hosts several computers that simulate the rocket’s environment on its entire trajectory, from liftoff to booster separation. Accompanied by realistic animations, the simulation feeds in flaming hot and space-cold temperatures to the sensors, delivers faux coordinates to the flight computer, and sends other flight “data” via 5 miles of cabling. Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel, Langley Research Center, Virginia: To make sure the rocket can withstand the supersonic winds of liftoff and flight, NASA engineers test every portion of its trajectory in wind tunnels. This three-foot steel scale model is coated with pastel pink paint that glows intensely neon under a blacklight depending on how much oxygen hits it. (Oxygen is a proxy for pressure in these tests.) Engineers can then determine exactly what forces the wind is exerting on the rocket and ensure that when the boosters separate from the rocket, they won’t, say, whip around and hit the thing. Orion test capsule, Johnson Space Center, Texas: The Navy uses a test capsule to practice retrieving astronauts from the ocean after Orion splashes down. Another is undergoing structural tests to see how it will fare if lightning strikes near the launch pad. NASA uses the capsule below to develop procedures for emergency situations. In one, astronauts would stuff dense stowage bags around them to block intense radiation from sudden solar flares. Engine test fire, Stennis Space Center, Mississippi:', 0, 0, 5, 1),

But now one researcher has dug up a new collection of bugs in email programs that in many cases strip away even the existing, imperfect protections against email impersonation, allowing anyone to undetectably spoof a message with no hint at all to the recipient. On Tuesday, security researcher and programmer Sabri Haddouche revealed Mailsploit, an array of methods for spoofing email in more than a dozen common email clients, including Apple Mail for iOS and macOS, Mozilla&#x27;s Thunderbird, Microsoft Mail, and Outlook 2016, as well as a long list of less common clients including Opera Mail, Airmail , Spark, Guerrilla Mail and Aol Mail. By combining the bugs in those email clients with quirks in how operating systems handle certain kinds of text, Haddouche was able to craft email headers that, to the recipient, give every indication of having been sent from whatever address the fraudster chooses. The potential for phishing schemes is enormous. A demo Haddouche has made available on his website describing the Mailsploit attack lets anyone send emails from any address they choose; think potus@whitehouse.gov, tcook@apple.com, john.podesta@gmail.com or any other corporate executive, politician, friend, family member, or associate that might trick someone into giving up their secrets. Thanks to Mailsploit&#x27;s tricks, no amount of scrutiny in the email client can reveal the fakery. &quot;This makes these spoofed emails virtually unstoppable at this point in time,&quot; writes Haddouche, who works as a developer for secure messaging service Wire. Email spoofing is a hacker trick as old as email itself. But over the years, administrators of email servers have increasingly adopted authentication systems, most recently one known as Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance, which blocks spoofed emails by carefully filtering out those whose headers pretend to come from a different source than the server that sent them. Partly as a result, phishers today generally have to use fake domains—the part of the email address after the &quot;@&quot;—that resemble real ones, or cram real-looking domains into the &quot;name&quot; field of their email. Either case is fairly easy to spot, if you&#x27;re careful to hover over or click on the &quot;from&quot; field of any suspicious-looking email. &#x27;This makes these spoofed emails virtually unstoppable at this point in time.&#x27; But Mailsploit&#x27;s tricks defeat DMARC by exploiting how email servers handle text data differently than desktop and mobile operating systems. By crafting email headers to take advantage of flawed implementation of a 25-year-old system for coding ASCII characters in email headers known as RFC-1342, and the idiosyncrasies of how Windows, Android, iOS, and macOS handle text, Haddouche has shown that he can trick email servers into reading email headers one way, while email client programs read them differently. &quot;The cleverness of this attack is that everything comes from the right source from the perspective of the mail server, but at the moment it’s displayed to the user it comes from someone else,&quot; says Dan Kaminsky, a protocol-focused security researcher and chief scientist at cybersecurity firm White Ops. &quot;The authentication system for the server sees one thing. The authentication system for humans sees another.&quot; Haddouche says he contacted all of the affected firms months ago to warn them about the vulnerabilities he&#x27;s found. Yahoo Mail, Protonmail and Hushmail have already fixed their bugs, while Apple and Microsoft have told Haddouche they&#x27;re working on a fix, he says. A Microsoft spokesperson wrote to WIRED to note that Outlook.com, Office 365, and Exchange 2016 aren&#x27;t affected by the attack. Most other affected services haven&#x27;t responded, Haddouche says. Haddouche&#x27;s full list of affected email clients and their responses to his Mailsploit research is here . 1 Mozilla and Opera, Haddouche says, both told him they don&#x27;t plan to fix their Mailsploit bugs, instead describing them as server-side problems. (On Wednesday, a Thunderbird developer Jörg Knobloch wrote to WIRED to note that Thunderbird will make a patch avaiable in the next 24 hours.) Blaming the server, rather than the email client, may be more than just a lazy dodge: Haddouche tells WIRED that email providers and firewalls can also be set to filter out his attack, even if email clients remain vulnerable. 1 Beyond the specific bugs Mailsploit highlights, Haddouche&#x27;s research points to a more fundamental problem with email authentication, says Kaminsky. Security add-ons for email like DMARC were designed to stop spam, not targeted spoofing, he points out. The fact that its whitelisting function also prevents most spoofing is almost an accident, he argues, and one that actually guarantees an email comes from who it appears to come from. &quot;This all part of the goop of email being a &#x27;90s protocol before security was a big deal,&quot; Kaminsky says. &quot;The system that accidentally prevents you from pretending to be the president of the US is good enough for spam protection, but it’s not good enough for phishing protection.&quot; Haddouche recommends that users stay tuned for more security updates to their email clients to fix the Mailsploit bugs, and that they consider switching in general to secure messengers like Wire, Whatsapp or Signal, which use more robust authentication mechanisms. And in the meantime, it&#x27;s always wise to treat emails with caution. Before opening an attachment or even clicking a link, it&#x27;s worth reaching out to the person via another channel for confirmation the message comes from who it claims to come from. And if you do get a message from potus@whitehouse.gov, don&#x27;t give him your PayPal password. 1 Updated 12/6/2017 at 5:55 pm EST to include comments from Microsoft and a Thunderbird developer.

But while they’re an imperfect security solution to begin with, putting in your best effort will provide an immediate security boost. Don’t think of the following tips as suggestions. Think of them as essentials, as important to your daily life as brushing your teeth or eating your vegetables. (Also, eat more vegetables.) 1. Use a password manager. A good password manager, like 1Password or LastPass , creates strong, unique passwords for all of your accounts. That means that if one of your passwords does get caught up in a data breach, criminals won&#x27;t have the keys to the rest of your online services. The best ones sync across desktop and mobile, and have autocomplete powers. Now, rather than having to memorize dozens of meticulously crafted passwords, you just have to remember one master key. How do you make it as robust as possible? Read on. 2. Go long. Despite what all those prompts for unique characters and uppercase letters might have you believe, length matters more than complexity. Once you get into the 12-15 character range, it becomes way harder for a hacker to brute force, much less guess, your password. One caveat: Don’t just string together pop culture references or use simple patterns. Mix it up! Live a little! A quick for instance: &quot;g0be@r$&quot; does you way less favors than &quot;chitown banana skinnydip.&quot; 3. Keep &#x27;em separated. If and when you do deploy those special characters—which, if you opt against a password manager, lots of input fields will force you to—try not to bunch them all together at the beginning or end. That’s what everyone else does, which means that’s what bad guys are looking for. Instead, space them out throughout your password to make the guesswork extra tricky. 4. Don’t change a thing. You know how your corporate IT manager keeps making you change your password every three months? Your corporate IT manager is wrong. The less often you change your password, the less likely you are to forget it, or to fall into patterns—like just changing a number at the end each time—that make them easier to crack. 5. Single-serve only. If you’re on the password manager train, you’re already all over this. But if you can’t be bothered, at the very least make sure that you don’t reuse passwords across different accounts. If you do, a retailer breach you have no control over could end up costing your banking password. See for yourself: The website Have I Been Pwned has nearly 5 billion compromised accounts on file—if yours is one of them, there’s a chance your favorite password might already be toast. 6. Don’t trust your browser. A convenient shortcut to remembering all those passwords, or getting a paid password manager account, is letting your browser remember them for you. You’ve seen the option yourself. You probably even use it on at least one site. Don’t! The option is convenient, but the underpinning security is often undocumented, and it doesn&#x27;t require that your password actually be, you know, good . If you need a free and easy option, go with a password manager like Dashlane instead of trusting everything to Chrome. 7. Add two-factor too. Hate to say it, but these days not even a password is enough. Many of the services you use today—social networks, banks, Google, and so on—offer an added layer of protection. It can come in the form of a code sent to your phone via SMS, or if you want to step it up, through software solutions like Google Authenticator or hardware like a YubiKey. SMS should be enough for most people; just know that like many entry level security precautions, it&#x27;s not perfect . More Tips for Civilians : One you master password tips, lock down your smartphone , keep yourself secure from phishers , know how to deal with getting doxed , and if you have kids, keep them safe online . Activist? Journalist? Politician? Consider Yourself a Target : Start by encrypting everything , sign up for Google Advanced Protection , take a tour of Tor , and deploy physical measures to increase your digital security.

(My last one was about werewolf billionaires. It was fiction.) And I’ve watched technology infiltrate countless trades and crafts, oftentimes improving how people do their jobs, all while passing storytellers by. Where’s the technology that can make me better at my job? Where’s the computational system that will optimize my prose? Hammond and Brooke agreed to collaborate with me on a simple experiment: Can an algorithm help me write a better story? I began by giving them a collection of my 50 favorite sci-fi stories—a mix of golden-age classics and some more recent stuff. (We decided I’d write a science-fiction piece, both for the obvious reasons and because sci-fi is easy to identify.) They used their program to compare my stories to a mass of other stories. First they came back to me with a series of stylistic guidelines that would make my story as much like the samples as possible—things like there had to be four speaking characters and a certain percentage of the text had to be dialog. Then they sent me a set of 14 rules, derived from a process called topic modeling, that would govern my story’s main topics and themes. All I had to do was start writing. Hammond and Brooke created a web-based interface through which their algorithm, called SciFiQ, could tell me, on the textual equivalent of the atomic level, how closely every single detail of my writing matched the details in my 50 favorite works. (I’m talking “nouns per 100 words” level.) When I typed in a word or phrase and it was more than a little different than what SciFiQ had in mind, the interface would light up red or purple. When I fixed the offending word or phrase, the interface would turn green. The key, obviously, was the texts that I selected: “Vaster than Empires and More Slow” by Ursula K. Le Guin, “The Father-Thing” by Philip K. Dick, “There Will Come Soft Rains” by Ray Bradbury—I can’t list them all, but you get the idea. I wanted to write something incredible, so I picked stories I thought were incredible. Whether that’s what I got might be another story. “Topic modeling,” Hammond says of the process he and Brooke used to create the 14 rules, “is mathematically sophisticated but otherwise stupid. The algorithm looks for words that tend to occur near one another in a very large corpus of text.” Based on how frequently the words appear together, Hammond determined what my story had to be about. For instance, after finding clusters of words throughout the texts that suggested extraterrestrial worlds and beings, he gave me rule number one: “The story should be set on a planet other than Earth.” The algorithm affected the story much more than I thought it would. Rule number one above seemed to conflict with rule number nine: “Include a scene set on a traditional Earth farm, with apple trees and corn fields.” The only way I could figure out how to follow both rules was to have someone on Earth viewing another planet. Which, I have to say, I like—the feeling that you’re watching helplessly as faraway events transpire. That suits our time, doesn’t it? “Profitable and marketable,” Ed said. “I cannot stress that enough.” “Profitable and marketable,” Anne murmured in agreement. The man at the viewer sucked out his face with a faint squelch and, with no acknowledgment of either Anne or Ed, began to pack up as quickly as possible. Anne had overdressed for her first day, obviously. Ed was night supervisor, but he was wearing blue-and-green overalls. The guy at the viewer was in head-to-toe sweats. His sallow eyes were exhausted 3 . He emanated a grotesque odor of off-brand bleach, and it burned the inside of Anne’s nostrils. And she was wearing her best outfit, the pencil-­skirt outfit she’d bought for her dissertation defense. What most writers and readers consider style (a recognizable way with words) is not what the algorithm considers style. It was developed to analyze average sentence length, variance in paragraph length, verbs per 100 words, and dozens of other statistics and patterns that my story would have to follow. “Once upon a time,” Ed continued, “people were interested in the Other world just because it was another world. There was discovery. Then there was building the telescopes, carrying the mercury to the translunar observatories, constructing the antigravity bases, the discs within discs of whirling silver the size of cities to capture the light.” The sallow man Anne was replacing misted the inside of the viewer with antiseptic spray and gently rubbed the screen down with a paper towel. Nodding curtly to each of them in turn, he half-jogged out the door. They were apparently not to be introduced. Her coworker couldn’t wait to be gone. “If you’re curious, go to the archives. I know, you’re a full prof, full xenologist. I know you’ve spent 10 years in the archives already, but you’ve got four hours tonight, well, three hours and 42 minutes. The archives have a hundred million hours cross-referenced. Your job is to keep looking to find something so we can justify keeping the lights on here.” “I understand.” “This light here,” he said, tapping the lamp. The glow from the viewer that no one was looking into unnerved Anne. The Other world, 1,564 light-years away, was flowing brightly 4 and glamorously 5 into the machine, unobserved, while Ed gave what must be his boilerplate orientation speech. I wrote a rough draft, based on the rules and guidelines, and dropped it into the interface. The first thing SciFiQ told me was that I used too few adverbs. I’ve always been taught to cut anything ending in ly , and I had to go back over the story putting in adverbs. Absurdly, good science fiction has a lot of adverbs. It wasn’t just adverbs either. It was adverbs per 100 words . So they had to be sprinkled throughout. “Nobody cares. That’s the thing to remember. While you’re here, I’ll be making phone calls to the South China coast begging for cash. Help me out. Keep the lights on here to keep an eye on there. That’s our motto now.” “Curiosity isn’t enough,” she said. “Curiosity isn’t enough. Exactly. You’re starting to understand. When people with money, people who matter, think of the Other, they think of aliens who have been dead for 1,500 years. It’s a nightmare, in a way, a planet of corpses who don’t know the oblivion they have momentarily escaped with us. Everybody knows. If they were ever going to find their way to us, they probably already would have. And if they’re looking at us, which they probably aren’t, what would we have to say to them? So it makes everybody sad, that there’s intelligent life out there and it doesn’t matter much. And sad is a hard sell.” Ed was obviously wrapping up. “You’re here to see, not to have insight. You will no doubt be struck by the reality of a planet so similar to ours, so distant from ours, and you will think deep thoughts about the loneliness of the cosmos. You may come to think even about the fate of a universe that is probably one of many universes, exemplified only by the fact that the universe that we happen to reside in happens to have created observers. Don’t bother sharing these digressions. They have already been written down by people who are 10,000 times more perspicacious than you and I and still managed to die in comprehensive obscurity.” The algorithm also told me what percentage of text should be dialog and how much of that dialog should come from female characters. This is where things get embarrassing. Turns out that, based on the stories I chose, only 16. 1 percent of the dialog could be from a woman’s point of view. Which is a crazily low number. Female writers historically write 40 to 50 percent of their dialog for female characters, male writers about 20 percent; so even by the shitty standards of male writers and history, this is appalling. It meant I had to make Anne shy and scholarly, and I had to make all the men around her bloviating assholes. Otherwise the dialog numbers wouldn’t work out. “Profitable and marketable,” 6 Anne repeated. “That’s correct. So tonight you have fewer than four hours to look at Othertribespeople on a ring of the lesser Chekhovs. Nobody knows much about them. They might have some new medicine. Anything that might have salable value, report.” The female dialog thing is still bugging me. If I had chosen a different 50 stories, or even changed one of the 50 stories, there would be a different outcome. I need to start reading better science fiction. “So I should call you if I see something new?” 7 “Call me if you see an Other holding up a sign that says, ‘Hello, Earth. It’s us up here.’ ” ______ At its peak, the Institution for the Study of Extraterrestrial Life had employed 264 fully trained researchers at the banks of screens. The mania for the Other had gripped the world, and every school devoted a class a week to its study. Universities all over the world had Other departments. Biologists handled the various pockets of life discovered in the rest of the universe, slimes mutating fiercely but drably on dozens of freezing or burning hells. The Other was its own field. The similarity had come as an existential shock to the earth. A planet 1,564 light-years away had forests that were not dissimilar to Earth’s forests. They had animals that were not that unlike the remaining animals on Earth. And they had the Others, who lived in cities, with streets, or in villages, or in tribes, just like us. The Others wore clothes. They fell in love. They wrote books. They kept time. They had laws. The odds of two worlds being conjured by chance at such similar points in their development—the Other was roughly at Earth’s 1964—had to mean something. The anthropic principle was considered proven. The universe could only exist under conditions in which ourselves and the Others were there to witness it. Those were the days when children, like Anne when she was a kid, wore pajamas with patterns of glublefrings gamboling among the tzitziglug trees, and everybody called it The Yonder. But all novelty eventually wears off. The natural market for the shock of recognition is perishingly small. Rule number 11: “Engage the sublime. Consider using the following words: vast, gigantic, strange, radiance, mystery, brilliance, fantastic, and spooky.” Alone in the vast 8 dark room, Anne wiped down the viewer again, just to be sure. She understood why there had been so many conspiracies in the days after discovery. It was like the machine fabricated the planet. Anne placed her face inside. The sucking in of the face curtains sealed her. She was hovering over a planet on the other side of the galaxy, 20 feet over a small group of Othertribespeople at night, fishing. The quality of the screen was so impeccable that the sense of her own body dissolved, and she was a floating dot. There was no comparison to watching a tape; this was live, or rather it was live 1,564 years ago. The tribe grouped tightly around a mountain stream. The males held torches up to the water, where a flurry of small fishes roiled on or under the surface, and a female Other poised, a spear in her hand, waiting for a gallack. They were huge, the gallacks, nearly the size of an Other. A single fish could feed a group of tribespeople for a month of desert season. The algorithm distinguishes between the “literariness” and “colloquialness” of any given word, and I had to strike the right balance between the two kinds. My number of literary words was apparently too high, so I had to go through the story replacing words like scarlet with words like red . Anne wanted to look a bit more closely. She reached down and her screen went blank. She had zoomed too far. She pulled up with a clenched fist and an elbow curl, and she was among the clouds above the mountains. The fire of the tribe’s torches made a red 9 and blue dot in the center. She pushed down slowly, adjusting. She had asked one of her dissertation supervisors what it was like working on the screens and he had told her it was like being an impotent god, and the description was precise. Delicately, tentatively, Anne focused on the face of the Other woman holding a spear. Sometimes a gallack might not come to light for hours, and when it did, it offered maybe three seconds of its purple-streaked skull bone for a strike. The Otherwoman’s eyes had narrowed sharply in concentration, her eyes small, even for the eyes of the Others, who had no nasal bridge, and whose button noses, like tiny dogs, were considerably more powerful than a human nose. A horrific violence lurked in her gaze. The Others stood so still, so intently and contentedly waiting for a slimy mammoth fish to rise out of the waters. Why was she watching this? The hope was that someone would hurt themselves in the hunt, and that the tribe would use an herb that had found an analogue in the surviving jungles on Earth to repair the damage. That’s how they had found that the bark of the Amazonian gluttaree had curative properties for Bell’s palsy. That was profitable and marketable. Only the leaves on the Other trees—she thought they were hualintratras, or maybe grubgrubs— moved at all 10 . The shimmering and the stillness were so different from the recordings, somehow. The recordings were always significant. That was the difference. Something had always happened to make them worth watching, worth preserving. The Othertribespeople were just waiting around for a gallack. Maybe the gallack would come, or maybe it wouldn’t. I loved writing descriptions of the Other planet, but I could only include a few. My story had to consist of about 26 percent dialog, so every time I wrote a bit of descriptive non-dialog, I knew I’d have to make up for it elsewhere with some talking. It was like working out probabilities when you’re playing poker. It wouldn’t really matter if she snuck off to the city for 20 minutes, would it? She marked the place of the tribe, flicked up with a curled fist, saw the planet whole for a second, found the biggest dot, centered herself visually, and pushed down. She landed accidentally in a funeral, right in the middle of the green twigs. Curling up, she could see that a ritual was in its final stages, the morbid consummation. The funeral must be in the Middle Space, off the straight avenue. Soon they would have a horrible shattering, a grandiose howl, an unconditional prostration. The crowd was small, six Others, so a prominent Other must have died. The body was already under the branches though, so Anne couldn’t quite tell. Rule number four: “The story should be set in a city. The protagonists should be seeing the city for the first time and should be impressed and dazzled by its scale.” She pulled up, too quickly, and she was once again too high. She hovered over the whole of the OSC, the Other South City, momentarily dazzled 11 . There were 24 million Others in the city, more than any city on Earth had held for 50 years, and that was without counting however many were living in the subterranean tunnels. Even at night, glowing with torches over the large avenues, the circles within interlocked circles, orbs within orbs which were so typically a figure of the Southern part of the main Continent, the City Center sprawled haphazardly. So much life. So much life to see. But all that life was none of her business. Her business was back on the lower Che­khovs. Anne flipped back to the saved locale. The Other­tribespeople were still waiting patiently for a big fish to come to light. Back in OSC, she floated over the Coil, the central avenue of the biggest Other city. The flashes of the running Others, the tumult of their flat faces. Who to follow? Who to forget? She followed one Other licking his lips anxiously. He turned off the corner and was gone. She followed another Other woman before she dipped into a store that sold texts. The universe is crammed with fascinating irrelevance. Anne was just watching now. All the work had already been done on the main streets, although it grew out of date so rapidly. When she had been a xenosociologist, she had studied some of the commercial patterns, the gift and theft matrices that seemed to be their version of exchange. That was before her department, and all the other departments except xenolinguistics, had been folded into general xenology. They were all just xenologists now. She widened her gaze and drifted into one of the neighborhoods halfway to the Uppertown Stage, or more than halfway if the city was still spreading since she had last read about it. The harsh tangerine dawn was rising on Other children as they played the string game in its labyrinthine star patterns laid out in the sand. She had written one of her first papers in grade school on geometrical erudition in Other children games, an A+. Her teacher, Ms. Norwood, had said, not quite believing it, that she might work at ISEL some day. She remembered that Ms. Norwood had been a devotee of Wodeck’s theory of distant proprioception, though it had been defunct as a theory even then. By virtue of the Heisenberg principle, Wodeck argued, we must be altering the Others in our observation of them. The idea was too Romantic for the academy or the public, both of whom thought Heisenberg was fine for electrons but not for aliens who had been dead for 1,500 years and whose remains had long since rotted to ashes by the time their light had arrived. The idea was doubly distasteful, because who knew who was watching us, and from where? Who wanted to believe their lives were shaped by alien eyes? Anne saw another Other girl, to a side of the players, reading pages, so she pushed in, focused, and caught a corner of the text, cut and pasted it into the archive comparer on the off chance it might be new and viable, a late entry into the now mostly unread library of the Other. Rule number six: “Include a pivotal scene in which a group of people escape from a building at night at high speed in a high tech vehicle made of metal and glass.” Then the book, in the middle of being copied, fluttered from the Other girl’s hands. The Other girl’s face was up, staring, in horrified confusion. Anne flicked over to where the Other child was looking. A smoldering hole had formed in the sand lot beside the children’s play space. A bizarre machine, unlike any devices she had seen in any xenology class, careened 12 at top pace down one of the lesser coils. She looked down. An Other man and an Other woman were riding in it, driving. The machine was large and silver. It would fit a bed. The thing must have ripped through the surface. She had never heard of that. She looked closer, and the Other man and the Other woman were carrying a baby, and they had a look of terror and tenderness on their haggard faces, pale from the cruelty of underground life. Anne pulled out with a curled fist, and they had no chance to escape. The restraint work of the Other authorities was always impressive in its brutality. The Others were monsters when it came to crime and punishment and angrily excised any difference with savagery. A remorseless circle of exalters, at least 30 of them, were coiling in on the fleeing Others. How long did they have? She looked back, flipped up. The Other man smiled at the Other woman for some obscure reason, cooed over the infant. She flipped back and the round group of the sinister exalters crept in, and then they all slowed, out of screen. She flipped back up and the strange machine had vanished. She curled up more. The machine had crashed into a boulder, and the Other woman with her baby were burning horribly inside the wreckage, and the Other man, thrown clear, lay dying on the gray sand. The Other man was looking straight up. He was looking straight up at Anne. He was staring at her across the galaxy right into her eye. Rule number 10: “Include extended descriptions of intense physical sensations and name the bodily organs that perceive these sensations.” The first part of that rule is generally good writing advice (make ‘em feel it), but the second part is innovative: It’s not just the description but the organs that matter. ______ Anne’s face, as it sucked out of the viewer, pulled slightly on the flaps, gently squeezing her eyeballs in their sockets 13 . Two hours and 17 minutes had passed. Time was always distorted by drifting over the Other, what with a 36 hour, 17 minute, 54 second day. Culture shock is always worse coming home. “Ed?” She called up the professor’s visuals from control. His face, on Skype, was the haggard face of a begging administrator on one call after another. “Hi Anne, did they hold up a sign saying ‘Hi, Earth’?” “I saw something.” “Is it profitable and marketable?” Was there profit in that rickety old machine somewhere? Was there some kind of profit in that? Or in the look of sadness on the Other’s face? “There’s lots of wonderful things to see, Anne. Nobody needs us here to show them a new wonderful thing. The moon shines wonderfully every evening. Nobody needs 70,000-ton telescopes in the sky to show them a place they have never seen before. If we want to keep an eye on, we have to find useful, profitable Otherness. Not the new and wonderful. Got it? ” “Got it.” “Profitable and marketable.” “Profitable and marketable.” The wreckage was still smoldering gruesomely on the viewer. The corpse of the Other man had already been cleared away. The machine, which must have been cobbled together in the underground, chuffed and spluttered smokily. And there was no way any of it could ever be profitable and marketable. Anne called Lee, a colleague from graduate school who had worked on subterranean history, and if she was recalling it right, even something with machines. He was living in Cairo these days, she thought, some kind of assistant professor at the uni there. This guy is here—this whole scene is here—because there needed to be four speaking characters and I needed more dialog. If I were just writing it myself, I would probably cut the whole section. “Is that Anne?” he asked 14 . He was older, more slovenly than she remembered, but it had been nearly 10 years. She reached him at a Shisha bar on Tahrir Square. “Is that the Anne who is working, I heard, at ISEL and who is actually looking into the sky?” “That’s me.” “And what can I do for Anne who has a good job at ISEL where she is looking into the sky?” “You once, long ago, studied the subterranea right?” Ordinarily, when I’m writing and I’m stuck with a line I don’t like, I work on finding the right way to write that line. The adjective sucks? I find a better adjective or cut the adjective altogether. But, in this case, that’s not enough. If you cut an adjective in one place, you have to put in an adjective somewhere else, and putting in that adjective somewhere else alters the balance of sentence length, paragraph length, paragraph length variation, and so on. It’s a bit like doing a Rubik’s cube. You fix one thing, you’ve messed up the side you weren’t looking at. The hitch in his voice swelled awkwardly, stringently, into a silence. The envy reached through the phone. Anne remembered. Lee had only managed a lousy archival job 15 , rustling in 10-year-old tapes for culinary elements. All the best dishes had been transferred years ago. “Wow. You’re actually at ISEL asking me a question about the subterranean, aren’t you?” “That I am.” His voice hitched again. “You didn’t see a real breakout, did you?” “Well, I’m not sure. I just want to know if there’s any history on the machines used in breakouts.” Lee paused, recognizing that his scholarship might matter, realizing that the Other existed, was existing, and he understood it, understood it usefully. “Well, a big book on subterranea as a prison system is Nguyen’s Other Underground , but that was 40 years ago or more even. The subterranea’s only had maybe a thousand hours of inspection over the past 20 years.” “Why is that?” “I guess they figure if the Others don’t care about it, why would we? People get bored with mysteries after awhile, for sure. And then there was an article a couple of years ago, out of the unit at Oxford. ‘Otherness among the Other,’ but it was general xenosociology. Wasn’t that your field?” “Before it all folded.” “Right. We’re all xenologists now. Also, there’s a footnote in my last paper in Otherism on the first escape, but you know all about that. So what can you tell me about your breakout?” She would be fired for a leak, even with Lee, even for a story no one cared to hear. Systems grow stricter as institutions decline. If there is nothing profitable or marketable in a thing, it must remain a secret or it has no value at all. Rule number five: “Part of the action should unfold at night during an intense storm.” One way of looking at this algorithm is as an editor. It’s commissioning a story with guidelines and then forcing me to write it the way it wants. If I don’t do it right, the algorithm makes me do it again, and again, until I get it right. ______ Her parents were still up when Anne, sick from the train and suffused with an indefinable and all-suffusing disappointment, rolled through the portico of the family farmstead. She found them in the viewing room, watching a new storm roll ferociously over the cornfields and the apple orchard. Mom was lying down, asleep, with her head on Dad’s lap. The lightning from the storm 16 was continuous enough that the room needed no other illumination, and Anne’s skin tingled furtively 17 with the electricity in the air. She sat beside her father in the noise of the rain that filled her ears like a cloying syrup. “How was the first day at ISEL?” he whispered. “Everything I thought it would be.” “And what did you think it would be then?” It was the first time that day that anyone had cared what Anne thought. And at that very moment she didn’t want to see or to record. At that very moment she just wanted to listen to the rain. “There’s just so much of it,” she said. “It is another world.” “And what are we doing looking at it?” “Keeping an eye on, right?” “Keeping an eye on what?” Anne’s father ran a hand through her mother’s hair a few moments. “This morning I was weighing in my mind that first book of the Other plants and animals we bought you. Remember that?” “Sure.” “And those bedroom sheets you wanted so badly, the ones with a little kangaroo-like Other thing on it. What are they called?” “Calotricks.” “And now you’re a grown-up woman, and they’re letting you look up in the sky from the big machines at ISEL.” The storm ripped the sky, harsh as a lash against her eyes. Her dad was proud of her, but she could tell he cared less for the Other world—the distant miracle, a sign however remote that we were not alone in the universe—than whether she would be able to move out now that she had a job. She was about to tell him about the nightmare chase of the burning woman and the dying man and the baby they took with them when her mother roused, and Dad shushed and began to sing: I chose the title of the story. Some things the algorithm didn’t get to decide. Did you know this poem was actually written by a person? A woman named Jane Taylor (1783–1824). And it’s so famous that everybody assumes nobody wrote it, that it just kind of appeared. That is the ultimate achievement of writing, that it’s so good that no person could have written it. How I wonder what you are. He picked up his wife and carried her out of the viewing room to bed. Anne was alone, more alone than before. “The fact that it’s really not that bad is kind of remarkable.” That’s how Rich, my human editor, described the story. I’ll take it. The exhaustion of the day accumulating inside her, she was glad of a half-dark room and a storm. As a child, to be even a cog in the celestial machinery would have been enough. She loved a whole other world, miraculously reflected in a skypiercing eye. She was middle-aged now: There was only light, moving through emptiness, trapped by machines 20 . Andy Ward, editor in chief, Random House “Topic modeling,” Hammond says of the process he and Brooke used to create the 14 rules, “is mathematically sophisticated but otherwise stupid. The algorithm looks for words that tend to occur near one another in a very large corpus of text.” Based on how frequently the words appear together, Hammond determined what my story had to be about. For instance, after finding clusters of words throughout the texts that suggested extraterrestrial worlds and beings, he gave me rule number one: “The story should be set on a planet other than Earth.” Back The algorithm affected the story much more than I thought it would. Rule number one above seemed to conflict with rule number nine: “Include a scene set on a traditional Earth farm, with apple trees and corn fields.” The only way I could figure out how to follow both rules was to have someone on Earth viewing another planet. Which, I have to say, I like—the feeling that you’re watching helplessly as faraway events transpire. That suits our time, doesn’t it? Back What most writers and readers consider style (a recognizable way with words) is not what the algorithm considers style. It was developed to analyze average sentence length, variance in paragraph length, verbs per 100 words, and dozens of other statistics and patterns that my story would have to follow. Back I wrote a rough draft, based on the rules and guidelines, and dropped it into the interface. The first thing SciFiQ told me was that I used too few adverbs. I’ve always been taught to cut anything ending in ly , and I had to go back over the story putting in adverbs. Absurdly, good science fiction has a lot of adverbs. Back It wasn’t just adverbs either.

Back The female dialog thing is still bugging me. If I had chosen a different 50 stories, or even changed one of the 50 stories, there would be a different outcome. I need to start reading better science fiction. Back Rule number 11: “Engage the sublime.

(500, 1, 'Google Is Giving Away AI That Can Build Your Genome Sequence', 'https://wired.com/story/google-is-giving-away-ai-that-can-build-your-genome-sequence', '2017-12-15 21:08:06', 'https://media.wired.com/photos/5a29cd4e15e73c599bf95401/master/pass/GoogleDNA-TAFA.jpg', 'Today, a teaspoon of spit and a hundred bucks is all you need to get a snapshot of your DNA . But getting the full picture—all 3 billion base pairs of your genome—requires a much more laborious process. One that, even with the aid of sophisticated statistics, scientists still struggle over. It’s exactly the kind of problem that makes sense to outsource to artificial intelligence . On Monday, Google released a tool called DeepVariant that uses deep learning —the machine learning technique that now dominates AI—to identify all the mutations that an individual inherits from their parents. 1 Modeled loosely on the networks of neurons in the human brain, these massive mathematical models have learned how to do things like identify faces posted to your Facebook news feed, transcribe your inane requests to Siri , and even fight internet trolls . And now, engineers at Google Brain and Verily (Alphabet’s life sciences spin-off) have taught one to take raw sequencing data and line up the billions of As, Ts, Cs, and Gs that make you you . And oh yeah, it’s more accurate than all the existing methods out there. Last year, DeepVariant took first prize in an FDA contest promoting improvements in genetic sequencing . The open source version the Google Brain/Verily team introduced to the world Monday reduced the error rates even further—by more than 50 percent. Looks like grandmaster Ke Jie isn’t be the only one getting bested by Google’s AI neural networks this year. DeepVariant arrives at a time when healthcare providers, pharma firms, and medical diagnostic manufacturers are all racing to capture as much genomic information as they can. To meet the need, Google rivals like IBM and Microsoft are all moving into the healthcare AI space, with speculation about whether Apple and Amazon will follow suit. While DeepVariant’s code comes at no cost, that isn’t true of the computing power required to run it. Scientists say that expense is going to prevent it from becoming the standard anytime soon, especially for large-scale projects. But DeepVariant is just the front end of a much wider deployment; genomics is about to go deep learning. And once you go deep learning, you don’t go back. It’s been nearly two decades since high-throughput sequencing escaped the labs and went commercial. Today, you can get your whole genome for just $1,000 (quite a steal compared to the $1.5 million it cost to sequence James Watson’s in 2008). But the data produced by today’s machines still only produce incomplete, patchy, and glitch-riddled genomes. Errors can get introduced at each step of the process, and that makes it difficult for scientists to distinguish the natural mutations that make you you from random artifacts, especially in repetitive sections of a genome. See, most modern sequencing technologies work by taking a sample of your DNA, chopping it up into millions of short snippets, and then using fluorescently-tagged nucleotides to produce reads—the list of As, Ts, Cs, and Gs that correspond to each snippet. Then those millions of reads have to be grouped into abutting sequences and aligned with a reference genome. From there they can go on to variant calling—identifying where an individual&#x27;s genes differ from the reference. 1 A number of software programs exist to help do that. FreeBayes, VarDict, Samtools, and the most well-used, GATK, depend on sophisticated statistical approaches to spot mutations and filter out errors. Each tool has strengths and weaknesses, and scientists often wind up having to use them in conjunction. No one knows the limitations of the existing technology better than Mark DePristo and Ryan Poplin. They spent five years creating GATK from whole cloth. This was 2008: no tools, no bioinformatics formats, no standards. “We didn’t even know what we were trying to compute!” says DePristo. But they had a north star: an exciting paper that had just come out, written by a Silicon Valley celebrity named Jeff Dean . As one of Google’s earliest engineers, Dean had helped design and build the fundamental computing systems that underpin the tech titan’s vast online empire. DePristo and Poplin used some of those ideas to build GATK, which became the field’s gold standard. But by 2013, the work had plateaued. “We tried almost every standard statistical approach under the sun, but we never found an effective way to move the needle,” says DePristo. “It was unclear after five years whether it was even possible to do better.” DePristo left to pursue a Google Ventures-backed start-up called SynapDx that was developing a blood test for autism. When that folded two years later, one of its board members, Andrew Conrad (of Google X, then Google Life Sciences, then Verily) convinced DePristo to join the Google/Alphabet fold. He was reunited with Poplin, who had joined up the month before. And this time, Dean wasn’t just a citation; he was their boss. As the head of Google Brain, Dean is the man behind the explosion of neural nets that now prop up all the ways you search and tweet and snap and shop. With his help, DePristo and Poplin wanted to see if they could teach one of these neural nets to piece together a genome more accurately than their baby, GATK. The network wasted no time in making them feel obsolete. After training it on benchmark datasets of just seven human genomes, DeepVariant was able to accurately identify those single nucleotide swaps 99.9587 percent of the time. “It was shocking to see how fast the deep learning models outperformed our old tools,” says DePristo. Their team submitted the results to the PrecisionFDA Truth Challenge last summer, where it won a top performance award. In December, they shared them in a paper published on bioRxiv . DeepVariant works by transforming the task of variant calling—figuring out which base pairs actually belong to you and not to an error or other processing artifact—into an image classification problem. It takes layers of data and turns them into channels, like the colors on your television set. In the first working model they used three channels: The first was the actual bases, the second was a quality score defined by the sequencer the reads came off of, the third contained other metadata. By compressing all that data into an image file of sorts, and training the model on tens of millions of these multi-channel “images,” DeepVariant began to be able to figure out the likelihood that any given A or T or C or G either matched the reference genome completely, varied by one copy, or varied by both. But they didn’t stop there. After the FDA contest they transitioned the model to TensorFlow , Google&#x27;s artificial intelligence engine, and continued tweaking its parameters by changing the three compressed data channels into seven raw data channels. That allowed them to reduce the error rate by a further 50 percent. In an independent analysis conducted this week by genomics computing platform, DNAnexus, DeepVariant vastly outperformed GATK, Freebayes, and Samtools, sometimes reducing errors by as much as 10-fold. “That shows that this technology really has an important future in the processing of bioinformatic data,” says DNAnexus CEO, Richard Daly. “But it’s only the opening chapter in a book that has 100 chapters.” Daly says he expects this kind of AI to one day actually find the mutations that cause disease. His company received a beta version of DeepVariant, and is now testing the current model with a limited number of its clients—including pharma firms, big health care providers, and medical diagnostic companies. To run DeepVariant effectively for these customers, DNAnexus has had to invest in newer generation GPUs to support its platform. The same is true for Canadian competitor, DNAStack, which plans to offer two different versions of DeepVariant—one tuned for low cost and one tuned for speed. Google’s Cloud Platform already supports the tool, and the company is exploring using the TPUs (tensor processing units) that connect things like Google Search, Street View, and Translate to accelerate the genomics calculations as well. DeepVariant’s code is open-source so anyone can run it, but to do so at scale will likely require paying for a cloud computing platform. And it’s this cost—computationally and in terms of actual dollars—that have researchers hedging on DeepVariant’s utility. “It’s a promising first step, but it isn’t currently scalable to a very large number of samples because it’s just too computationally expensive,” says Daniel MacArthur, a Broad/Harvard human geneticist who has built one of the largest libraries of human DNA to date. For projects like his, which deal in tens of thousands of genomes, DeepVariant is just too costly. And, just like current statistical models, it can only work with the limited reads produced by today’s sequencers. Still, he thinks deep learning is here to stay. “It’s just a matter of figuring out how to combine better quality data with better algorithms and eventually we’ll converge on something pretty close to perfect,” says MacArthur. But even then, it’ll still just be a list of letters. At least for the foreseeable future, we’ll still need talented humans to tell us what it all means. 1 Correction 12/12/17 4:28pm EST An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to what DeepVariant does as &quot;assembling genomes.&quot; The tool calls variants, which is an important part of the genotyping process, but one not involved in genome assembly.

First, they wanted to create an AI system that can spawn new AI systems, which are more sophisticated than what humans can design. Second, they wanted to test this system to identify objects in real time with remarkable accuracy. They&#x2019;ve done both&#x2013;and their research has vast implications for everything from surveillance to self-driving cars. Designing machine learning models is remarkably tedious. It requires significant time and expertise, so to speed things up, Google&#x2019;s researchers created AutoML,&#xA0; a machine learning model designed to create other machine learning models using an approach called reinforcement learning . This method has a controller neural network that can create a &#x201C;child&#x201D; network to execute a specific task. In this case, the task was to recognize objects in a real-time video feed, like people, cars, traffic lights, handbags, or backpacks. The &#x201C;child&#x201D; model trains for the task and gets evaluated by the controller AI, which learns from the feedback and refines the child&#x2013;a process that gets repeated thousands of times until the child model gets really good. [Image: Barret Zoph, Vijay Vasudevan, Jonathon Shlens, and Quoc V. Le./ Arxiv ] How good? The Google Brain researchers claim that their machine-designed model beats all state-of-the-art computer vision systems created by people. They applied AutoML to the ImageNet image classification and COCO object detection data set, which according to the Google team are &#x201C;two of the most respected large-scale academic data sets in computer vision.&#x201D; This graphic shows the accuracy of their system&#x2013;called NASNet&#x2013;in red: [Image: Google Research Blog ] Not only is NASNet vastly more accurate, it&#x2019;s more efficient than other models. According to the researchers&#x2019; article, it halves &#x201C;the computational cost of the best reported result on arxiv.org (SENet). &#x201D; Self-driving cars are one obvious use of this architecture. You can imagine the system helping Google&#x2019;s AVs identify traffic, pedestrians, and road hazards. NASNet could also be used in augmented reality to help apps interact with the environment in a faster, more accurate way that current computer vision solutions. But perhaps the most intriguing applications have yet to be identified. Google&#x2019;s researchers decided to make NASNet public here (for image classification) and here (for object detection) , so other scientists can make use of it. Of course, automating automation raises some alarming questions. How do&#xA0; you ensure you aren&#x2019;t building a biased system that then passes that bias onto another system? How do you ensure the systems are used ethically? I can imagine some dystopian applications, like&#xA0;automated surveillance, in which computers constantly analyze images to flag objects or activities that they consider suspicious. That could be a boon to public safety or it could be the makings of a police state. I can also imagine refining the system to recognize faces on the fly and follow anyone across a city. NASNet can address &#x201C;multitudes of computer vision problems we have not yet imagined,&#x201D; the researchers write. For better or for worse .', 0, 0, 5, 1);

Further photo and video analysis since, though, indicate that the missile test represents an even greater advance in capabilities than analysts first thought. And as the international community grapples with the geopolitical implications, more North Korean missile sophistication means more tough questions for the country&#x27;s enemies. Many analysts originally assumed that North Korea this week launched an improved version of a Hwasong-14 missile, the ICBM the country successfully tested twice in July . But North Korean photos and video show that while the rocket tested on Tuesday is a two-stage, liquid-fueled missile that has some similar features to the Hwasong-14, the latest effort is significantly larger, and has a first stage powered by two engines instead of one. The second stage also seems to have more propellant than the Hwasong-14. A bigger and more powerful rocket can carry a heavier load farther, so analysts note that the new missile, dubbed the Hwasong-15, can likely carry a North Korean warhead as far as Kim Jong-un could want—including anywhere in the continental US. The North Korean government claimed in a television broadcast that the Hwasong-15 has &quot;much greater advantages in its tactical and technological specifications and technical characteristics.” &quot;I’m not surprised that they eventually tested something like they did on Tuesday, I just thought they would try to better understand the Hwasong-14 and then move,&quot; says Michael Elleman, a senior fellow for missile defense at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and an analyst for the North Korean watchdog group 38 North. &quot;Now they’ve just stepped straight up into the Hwasong-15.&quot; The new missile can likely carry a North Korean warhead as far as Kim Jong-un could want—including anywhere in the continental US. In the last two years, as Kim Jong-un dramatically ramped up North Korea&#x27;s ICBM development and testing, the country has been gradually surmounting the list of technological challenges that were keeping it from becoming a full fledged nuclear power. It showed that it could adequately miniaturize a warhead, worked on liquid versus solid fueling issues, flew two missiles over Japan , and conducted its sixth—and most powerful— nuclear bomb test yet at the beginning of September. The country has certainly had launch failures, including a series of misfires with the Musudan, or Hwasong-10, missiles in 2016, and another in April . But with a number of recent launches going relatively smoothly, the program&#x27;s momentum has increased. &quot;While I don’t have definitive proof, all the evidence points to North Korea having imported key hardware specifically the engines,&quot; 38 North&#x27;s Elleman says. &quot;That is a major source of failures at the beginning of a program, and they’ve basically acquired flight-proven hardware in the engines. It’s quite impressive even with imported hardware, but I think this is what has allowed them to move forward so quickly and not experience failed tests.&quot; North Korea has also continued work on its submarine-launched ballistic missile program, according to new analysis on Friday, also from 38 North. Satellite images show that the country is preparing to deploy one of its submersible test stand barges, presumably to work on or conduct an underwater ICBM launch. The country also continues to produce fissile material for its weapons. North Korea&#x27;s impending status as a full nuclear power has created increasing international tension and unease. The US has always had limited options in dealing with the Hermit Kingdom, but getting North Korea to agree to a weapons development freeze is no longer one of them. Defense Secretary James Mattis said on Thursday that he is still focused on diplomatic negotiations. “I am not willing to say that diplomacy has not worked. We will continue to work diplomatically,&quot; Mattis said. &quot;At the same time, our diplomats will speak from a position of strength because we do have military options.” The country is likely much less focused on perfection than nations like the US, Russia, and China. North Korea remains unlikely to actually strike the US with a nuclear missile, given the undoubtably severe response such an attack would provoke. Analysts generally view North Korea&#x27;s nuclear ambitions as an avenue to gain leverage in negotiations on the world stage, a deterrent against attacks, and a safeguard against any international efforts to undermine the current regime. The Trump administration&#x27;s volatile rhetoric on North Korea, though, particularly from the President himself , has led to fears that now any small incident or miscalculation could escalate into a larger crisis. &quot;At this point we’re into this mode where we have to be worried about deterrence functioning stably,&quot; says Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute for International Studies in Monterey, California. &quot;We want to make sure that there’s no possibility of an accident or a misperception or a miscalculation, and so we’re in this very difficult situation.&quot; Experts say that some technical challenges still remain for the country as well. The country&#x27;s reentry vehicles are essentially untested in real-world conditions, the precision missile targeting systems are probably still questionable, and North Korean engineers will now need to work on the reliability of the system as a whole so it can function at a moment&#x27;s notice. But all of those objectives are attainable, given what North Korea has shown so far. And don&#x27;t forget—the country is likely much less focused on perfection than nations like the US, Russia, and China. &quot;What normally happens in other countries is after you’ve got four or five tests under your belt, you start doing tests under a variety of conditions and that usually takes a dozen to two dozen flight tests. But North Korea can probably live with ‘it succeeds more often than it fails,’&quot; 38 North&#x27;s Elleman says. &quot;So my bottom line is that three or four more tests, if they’re successful and they fly them on a fairly normal trajectory, North Korea would likely move ahead, deploy the systems, declare them combat ready and then, yeah, grab a beer.&quot; CNMN Collection Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our user agreement (effective 3/21/12) and privacy policy (effective 3/21/12).

Like something strange has been walking and rolling among us? Like we’re now sharing the planet with a new species of our own creation? Well, we are, because 2017 was the year that the robots really, truly arrived. They escaped the factory floor and started conquering big cities to deliver Mediterranean food . Self-driving cars swarmed the streets . And even bipedal robots—finally capable of not immediately falling on their faces— strolled out of the lab and into the real world. The machines are here, and it’s an exhilarating time indeed. Like, now Atlas the humanoid robot can do backflips . Backflips . “2017 has been an amazing year for robotics,” says roboticist Sebastian Thrun, a pioneer of the self-driving car. “Why 2017? Why did it take us so long?” Well, it was a confluence of factors, namely the cheapening of sophisticated hardware combined with better brains. “In the past, in robotics we had not-so-smart software with hardware that would break all the time, and that&#x27;s not a good product,&quot; Thrun says. &quot;It&#x27;s only recently that both computers have become smart enough and that robot hardware has become reliable enough that the very first products start to emerge.” Perhaps the biggest leap in hardware has been sensor technology. To build a robot you don’t have to babysit, you need it to sense its environment, and to sense its environment it needs a range of sensors. Not just with cameras, but with lasers that build a 3-D map of the robot’s surroundings. These kinds of components have gotten both far more powerful and far cheaper. “I kind of talk about this finally being the golden age of robotics, and that means that for the first time in the last 12 months or so you see robots really becoming prolific,” says Ben Wolff, CEO of Sarcos Robotics, which makes the most bonkers robot arms you’ve ever seen . “And I think it&#x27;s because we&#x27;re finally at that crossover point, where the cost has come down of components while the capability of the components has increased sufficiently.” Like, come down big time. One sensor cost Sarcos a quarter of a million dollars in 2010. Today, it’s $8,000—that’d be 3 percent of the cost just seven years ago. Other components like actuators—the motors in the joints of something like a robot arm—are also falling steadily in cost. Today, an actuator that once cost $3,500 is closer to $1,500. And it&#x27;s actuators, perhaps more than any other component, that promise to take robotics to the next level in the very near future. Loaded with cheaper, supercharged sensors, robots are finally capable of tackling the uncertainty of the human world. Whether humans actually want that is another question. Take delivery robots, for instance. In San Francisco’s chaotic Mission neighborhood this year, a robot called Marble began picking up food and delivering it straight to customers’ doors. Yet it’s not navigating the relatively structured streets—with lanes and stop signs and such—but sidewalks. That means it has to dodge pedestrians and buskers and discarded furniture, then still be able to cross the street and deal with cars. It ain’t perfect, which is why a human handler follows the robot to remote-control it when it gets in trouble (when WIRED got a demo in April, it nearly ran down a dog ). That safeguard wasn&#x27;t enough for the SF Board of Supervisors, which earlier this month voted to severely restrict the operation of the machines . Regulations aside, robotics are only set to encroach further on human spaces. “In the past we had robots that were novelty,” says Wolff. “We certainly had robots that could do repetitive tasks bolted to the floor for years and years. But what&#x27;s changed is we&#x27;re now talking about robots that are mobile in nature.” Much of that has to do with the robots’ bigger brains. It takes a whole lot of processing power for a robot to eyeball a person and navigate around them, while at the same keeping on its trajectory and avoiding other humans. Luckily, better chips mean all of these calculations can now happen aboard the machine, as opposed to giant computers doing the processing in the cloud. Specifically, the smartphone revolution has helped shrink down processors while making them burlier and cheaper and more energy-efficient. Perfect for little robots like Kuri . So where do we go from here? And I do mean we . Our human brains tend to anthropomorphize anything that remotely seems like an intelligent agent, so it&#x27;s tempting to form bonds with the machines, especially when they’re “cute” and “lovable.” I mean, back in August it happened to me: I told a robot I loved it just to get its attention . Those human-robot relationships are primed for ethical upsets. Imagine a child forming a bond with a highly intelligent doll. At some point, the manufacturer might exploit that relationship by having the doll ask the kid if they want an over-the-air update that’d make the robot even more fun—for the low, low price of $49.99. It’s early, I know—I just got through saying the robots have arrived. But as someone who’s experienced the surprising psychological draw of robots, I want to make this clear: The robot-human relationship is bizarre and fraught with potential misadventures . Better to think of this now than have a doll suddenly bilking you out of money.

Today in Science Robotics , researchers from the University of Tokyo show off a humanoid that is strikingly lifelike not just in how it looks, but how it moves. The machine is a radical departure from the stiff, bumbling humanoids that have so far done a whole lot of falling on their faces . (Props to Boston Dynamics’ latest iteration of Atlas, though, which can do backflips now .) Kengoro is its name, and badminton is its game, even though it’s not super great at it. Oh, also, it can sweat. The idea with Kengoro, and its older iteration Kenshiro, is to replicate the human body as closely as possible. The researchers modeled Kenshiro after a 13-year-old male, so it weighs in at 115 pounds. Kengoro is slightly heavier. And the ratio of things like foot length and shoulder height to human figures are all almost exact for both robots. Let’s focus on Kengoro though, since it’s more newfangled. Your typical humanoid robot moves thanks to actuators—a fancy name for a motor combined with a gearbox —in its joints. Very inhuman. Kengoro’s 116 actuators instead pull on wires that mimic the contraction of human muscles. These &quot;muscles&quot; are even arranged like they are in the human body (though the analog of the human calf muscle is made of two actuators to produce enough force). Think of it like the world’s most advanced marionette. Actuators, though, inevitably produce heat, in Kengoro or any other robot. So Kengoro sweats. Water circulates through its metal frame, which is made of a special porous aluminum. This allows the heated water to escape as vapor, thus releasing heat from the motors . As an added bonus, that aluminum gives the robot a sturdy frame. But Kengoro is also extremely flexible, with six times the degrees of freedom as traditional humanoids. It can move its head from side to side like it&#x27;s cracking its neck. It can even stand on its tippy toes. That’s all thanks to those &quot;muscles,&quot; in contrast to just a handful of motors powering the joints of a more traditional humanoid. Also, Kengoro has a flexible spine. That’s why it can do sit-ups that look like human sit-ups. Try getting a traditional humanoid to do this and it’ll fold more like a Lego minifigure. Kengoro, though, does lose out on the rigidity of its Lego-esque comrades. Boston Dynamics’ Atlas can do backflips because it doesn’t crumple when it lands. Still, Kengoro is no weakling—it can lift its own body weight in a pull-up. So this bot is a bit more loosey-goosey, fine. But its lower-power profile means it can afford to slim down to more accurately mimic a human. That could be useful for a number of reasons, not all of which Kengoro will want to hear. For one, you could turn it into a very useful crash dummy. Modern dummies are packed with sophisticated sensors, sure, but they’re still passive. Meaning, Kengoro could get in there and better simulate how a real live human body responds to a crash. The cost of the robot would have to come way down for that to be feasible, though. In the nearer term, the robot could inform the design of robotic limbs. And while humanoids seem silly right now, they’re only going to get more sophisticated. Less … face-planty. At some point, they may come in handy as rescue robots, navigating environments other machines can’t. After all, humans built this world for humans. To make sense of, say, a melted-down nuclear facility, it’s probably best if you have legs to climb stairs and hands to turn valves. For now, though, it’s push-ups and back extensions for Kengoro.

Centralized Transactions Economy This TED Talks presented by Bettina Warburg on blockchain examines a brief history of the role uncertainty plays when making transactions. For instance, when purchasing a product, both the buyer and seller need assurances: that the other person is who she claims to be, that the product is as advertised, that the buyer compensates the seller, that the seller gives the buyer the product, and that there is recourse if any of the terms of the transaction are not met. Currently, our economy relies on institutions — banks, governments, and corporations — as central authorities to reduce uncertainty in transactions. Centralized Internet Our current model of the Internet is also a centralized system. Data is stored on web servers. When we want to receive data on the Internet, such as view a website or download a file, our web browser sends a request to the web server that hosts that data, and the web server responds to that request by providing the requested data. A centralized Internet is not fault tolerant: if a server goes down, the entire system is affected. In complex terms, what is blockchain? Blockchain is a cryptographically secure database containing an immutable history of transactions where each transaction contains a digital signature. A block’s digital signature is generated using a cryptographic hash function that links the new block to the previous block. In essence, it’s just a massive ledger of transaction history. Blockchain from a programmer’s perspective The following code snippets are based on this YouTube tutorial by YouTuber Ivan on Tech on how to code a simple blockchain in Java. A Block object would store three fields: the previous block’s hash value, a string array containing the list of transactions, and its own hash value. A new block is created by passing in the previous block’s hash value and the array of transactions to the Block constructor. The block’s hash value is generated by passing in the previous hash value and the transactions array’s hash into the hash code function. The blockchain is immutable in that once constructed, its fields are encapsulated in the block and can only be accessed through getter methods. The transaction history of a blockchain is stored across a peer-to-peer network of personal computers. These personal computers both utilize and facilitate the blockchain system, and no individual person or entity owns it. This makes the blockchain network both decentralized and distributed. Unlike in the client-server model, the blockchain does not have a single point of failure. Rather than a single entity providing assurances, transactions are validated by consensus across the network. Big companies are getting involved Blockchain technology has the potential to solve problems in the transactional economy. So it’s no surprise that blockchain has captured the attention of major banks and companies. Microsoft is one of many companies getting involved in the Decentralized Identity Foundation ( DIF ). The project’s mission is to solve problems related to online identity by using blockchain technology. This is just one of many examples. Currently, many companies, including IBM and Microsoft, are looking to hire blockchain developers. Read this article to see a list of other companies getting involved in blockchain technology.

Consider what has happened to the founders of an upstart virtual currency known as Ripple, which has seen its value skyrocket in recent weeks. At one point on Thursday, Chris Larsen, a Ripple co-founder who is also the largest holder of Ripple tokens, was worth more than $59 billion, according to figures from Forbes . That would have briefly vaulted Mr. Larsen ahead of Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg into fifth place on the Forbes list of the world’s richest people. Other top Ripple holders would have also zoomed up that list as the value of their tokens soared more than 100 percent during the last week — and more than 30,000 percent in the last year. The boom has turned Ripple into the second largest virtual currency, within striking distance of the original behemoth, Bitcoin. The explosion in Ripple’s value over the past month is the starkest illustration yet of how the mania around Bitcoin has spilled over into a broader universe of virtual currencies. These coins — with names like Cardano, Stellar, and Iota — are generally new twists on the Bitcoin technology, which uses a decentralized network of volunteer computers to keep a record, known as a blockchain, of all transactions. While most of these currencies were worth nearly nothing a year ago, many are now responsible for creating billionaires — albeit with rapidly fluctuating fortunes. If this is a tulip fever, the fever has spread to chrysanthemums and poppies. Mr. Larsen’s soaring wealth sparked a few congratulatory messages on Twitter on Thursday, even if the value of Ripple — and his Forbes ranking — dropped later in the day. But his net worth, and the ballooning value of Ripple tokens, mostly drew comments about the irrationality of the virtual currency markets, which appear to be largely driven these days by the fear of missing out, or FOMO. “This is beyond insane,” said Jeremy Gardner, an investor who previously worked at the virtual currency hedge fund Blockchain Capital, which invested in Ripple. “There’s absolutely nothing driving this rally except rampant FOMO, misinformation, and speculation.” Ripple, whose tokens are known as XRP, is far from the only virtual currency being fueled by the hysteria. In 2017, there were 29 tokens — including Einsteinium and Byteball — that rose more than Bitcoin’s remarkable 1,600 percent jump, according to OnChainFx, a data provider. Nearly 40 virtual currencies are worth more than $1 billion — when all the outstanding tokens are counted at their current value — despite many of them not having been used in any sort of transaction other than speculative trading. Against this backdrop, Ripple could be considered a staid institution, though one with a colorful history. Ripple was invented in 2012 by Jed McCaleb, a programmer who had created Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin exchange that later dissolved in disgrace . Mr. McCaleb designed Ripple as a faster and more efficient version of Bitcoin, without the mining process that Bitcoin uses to distribute new coins and secure the network. Mr. Larsen joined Mr. McCaleb early on to create a company, also known as Ripple. The company helped develop an open source Ripple software that makes it possible to move money between digital wallets. The Ripple token is one of the currencies that can be transferred with the software. Mr. McCaleb later left Ripple in an acrimonious divorce, though he retained a sizable number of Ripple tokens. His holdings were worth around $20 billion at Thursday’s prices, putting him close to 40th on the Forbes list. (The actual list is only published once a year, and no big virtual currency holders have been officially added.) Mr. McCaleb has since created a competitor to Ripple, known as Stellar. Stellar has risen even faster than Ripple in recent weeks, with all outstanding Stellar tokens — known as Lumens — worth around $14 billion on Thursday, making it the seventh largest virtual currency. In contrast, all the outstanding Ripple tokens were worth $140 billion on Thursday, while all Bitcoin were worth $250 billion. Yet the fortunes of Mr. McCaleb and Mr. Larsen are not nearly as durable as those of other people on the Forbes list given that the value of virtual currencies fluctuates wildly. If Mr. Larsen wanted to access his wealth by selling Ripple tokens for dollars, it would likely drive down the value of Ripple tokens — and his riches. Mr. McCaleb and Mr. Larsen did not respond to questions about the recent price increases. Mr. Larsen was Ripple’s chief executive from 2012 until he stepped down last year to become the company’s executive chairman. During his tenure, Ripple focused on helping banks use its software to shift money between different foreign currencies, something that most banks currently do through a cumbersome process involving separate accounts in every country where they operate. Ripple has said it has signed up more than 100 banks to use the company’s technology, including American Express and Banco Santander. But banks do not need to use Ripple tokens for Ripple’s software to transfer dollars, euros and yen. That point appears to be lost on many small time investors who are buying Ripple tokens. Most of the buying and selling of Ripple tokens is happening in South Korea, according to data providers that track virtual currency exchanges, where ordinary investors have thrown money at a wide array of virtual currencies. Several virtual currency hedge fund investors said that they have talked to banks and heard about interest in Ripple’s software, but not its tokens. “I’m not aware of banks using or planning to use the XRP token at the scale of tens of billions of dollars necessary to support XRP’s valuation,” said Ari Paul, a co-founder of the hedge fund BlockTower Capital. Ripple has so far announced that one company, a Mexican money-transfer business, is planning to use the Ripple token. Brad Garlinghouse, who took over as Ripple’s chief executive last year, said in an interview this week that other institutions are also using — or looking at using — XRP, but the company could not name them because of confidentiality agreements. Mr. Garlinghouse said he thought the rising value of Ripple tokens was justified, given the company’s growth and the size of the foreign currency markets that Ripple wants to tackle. “It’s clear that people increasingly understand that we are solving a very large problem,” he said. Ripple has attracted the ire of Bitcoin fans because Ripple has a greater degree of centralized authority in Mr. Garlinghouse’s company, even though the Ripple software is open source. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies were designed to operate without companies or governments in charge. But the company Ripple, if not the XRP token, has won a following among top figures in government and finance who are interested in bringing the ideas introduced by Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. The company’s board includes the former top financial regulator in New York state, Benjamin M. Lawsky, and Gene Sperling, who was the director of the National Economic Council under Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Still, even virtual currency analysts who believe in Ripple’s software have said there is a big difference between Ripple the company being successful, and Ripple the token gaining enough traction to justify current prices. “An impossibly long list of things already needs to go right for XRP to become a reserve currency for banks,” Ryan Selkis, a virtual currency analyst, wrote in a post on Thursday . But, Mr. Selkis added, that doesn’t mean Ripple’s price won’t keep ascending. Why? “Because this is crypto, and everyone in the industry is now slinging crack crypto cocaine to retail addicts,” he wrote. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

But there is no direct evidence to support this contention, no large study comparing brain development in living populations that do and do not practice head flattening. An extensive review article in the journal Anthropology in 2003 speculated that the practice of compression had the potential to damage the delicate developing frontal lobe, as is seen in certain conditions. The authors speculated that such damage could have impaired vision, object recognition, hearing ability, memory, attentiveness and concentration. These factors in turn might have contributed to behavior disorders and difficulty in learning new information.

The former publisher, H. Brandt Ayers, told the newspaper that it was “in the best interests of the paper and its mission” to step down from the board at its parent company, Consolidated Publishing. But his family will retain control of the company, which also owns five other publications, and his wife will take over as chairwoman of the board. “It is of utmost importance to me that this newspaper continue to serve its role of reporting on matters of concern to the Anniston community and that nothing stand in the way of preserving the newspaper as an independently owned publication serving this community,” Mr. Ayers said in his statement to The Star. He could not be reached for comment on Thursday. His resignation came after several former reporters accused him in recent days of sexual misconduct — allegations that brought about a swift downfall for Mr. Ayers, who led The Star during the civil rights era as a rare liberal in the South. After taking over The Star from his father in the 1960s, Mr. Ayers wrote editorials denouncing bigotry and advocating school integration. In an article published on Monday , a former reporter for The Star, Veronica Pike Kennedy, told the newspaper that Mr. Ayers spanked her against her will on a Saturday in 1975 when there were few people in the building. “I was still determined to be a reporter after that,” Ms. Kennedy, who worked at the newspaper in her 20s, told The Star. “But I hated Brandy Ayers with every cell in my body.” In response to the accusations, Mr. Ayers, who was 40 in 1975, told the newspaper that he had made mistakes as a young journalist but did not address the specific allegations. But on Tuesday, Mr. Ayers acknowledged in an interview with The Star that he spanked another reporter, Wendy Sigal, at her home in 1973 or 1974. Mr. Ayers claimed that Ms. Sigal had an ailment and that a doctor told him that spanking her could help. “I called the doctor and asked what should do, and he said ‘calm her down,’” Mr. Ayers told The Star . When a reporter at the newspaper recently asked him about the accusation from Ms. Kennedy, he replied, “Let the accusation stand.” Mr. Ayers stepped down as publisher in 2016 but stayed on as chairman of Consolidated Publishing in Anniston, a city of 22,000 about halfway between Atlanta and Birmingham, Ala. The current publisher, Bob Davis, said the paper was drafting a policy on sexual harassment that will outline how employees can report inappropriate behavior. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

But because of the diagnosis’s bold proposition: Humans, in their natural state, are meant to thrive. My patient, however, was not in his natural state. Cancer had claimed nearly every organ in his body. He’d lost a quarter of his body mass. I worried his ribs would crack under the weight of my stethoscope. “You know,” he told me the evening I admitted him. “A few years ago, I wouldn’t have cared if I made it. ‘Take me God,’ I would’ve said. ‘What good am I doing here anyway?’ But now you have to save me. Sadie needs me.” He’d struggled with depression most of his life, he said. Strangely enough, it seemed to him, he was most at peace while caring for his mother when she had Parkinson’s, but she died years ago. Since then, he had felt aimless, without a sense of purpose, until Sadie wandered into his life. Sadie was his cat. Only about a quarter of Americans strongly endorse having a clear sense of purpose and of what makes their lives meaningful, while nearly 40 percent either feel neutral or say they don’t. This is both a social and a public health problem: Research increasingly suggests that purpose is important for a meaningful life — but also for a healthy life. Purpose and meaning are connected to what researchers call eudaimonic well-being . This is distinct from, and sometimes inversely related to, happiness (hedonic well-being). One constitutes a deeper, more durable state, while the other is superficial and transient. Being a pediatric oncologist, for example, is not a “happy” job, but it may be a very rewarding one. Raising a family can be profoundly meaningful, but parents are often less happy while interacting with their children than exercising or watching television. Having purpose is linked to a number of positive health outcomes, including better sleep , fewer strokes and heart attacks , and a lower risk of dementia , disability and premature death . Those with a strong sense of purpose are more likely to embrace preventive health services , like mammograms, colonoscopies and flu shots. And people with high scores on measures of eudaimonic well-being have low levels of pro-inflammatory gene expression; those with high scores on hedonic pleasure have just the opposite. Doing good, it seems, is better than feeling good. One study analyzed how having purpose influences one’s risk of dementia. Researchers assessed baseline levels of purpose for 951 individuals without dementia, then followed them for seven years, controlling for things like depression, neuroticism, socioeconomic status and chronic disease. Those who had expressed a greater sense of purpose were 2.4 times less likely to develop Alzheimer’s, and were far less likely to develop even minor cognitive problems. Another study followed more than 6,000 individuals over 14 years and found that those with greater purpose were 15 percent less likely to die than those who were aimless, and that having purpose was protective across the life span — for people in their 20s as well as those in their 70s. Having purpose is not a fixed trait, but rather a modifiable state: Purpose can be honed through strategies that help us engage in meaningful activities and behaviors. This has implications at both the dinner table and the hospital bed. A recent randomized control trial compared the effect of “meaning-centered” versus “support-focused” group therapy for patients with metastatic cancer. Patients in the support groups met weekly and discussed things like “the need for support,” “coping with medical tests” and “communicating with providers.” Patients in the meaning-centered groups focused instead on spiritual and existential questions. They explored topics like “meaning before and after cancer,” “what made us who we are today,” and “things we have done and want to do in the future.” Meaning-centered patients experienced fewer physical symptoms, had a higher quality of life, felt less hopeless — and were more likely to want to keep living . Other research suggests that school programs that allow students to discuss positive emotions and meaningful experiences may enhance psychological well-being, and protect against future behavioral challenges. But this isn’t how we usually operate. We instead assume that anxiety and depression are problems to be treated — not that emotional resilience and human flourishing are states to be celebrated. What’s powerful about these conversations is not just that they can help cancer patients through treatment or help teenagers build resiliency — they can also help the rest of us. We should all consider asking ourselves and our loved ones these questions more often. During my most trying months of medical school, I met every Sunday evening with three friends. Phones off, lights dim, wine glasses full. We shared the most challenging and most rewarding moments of our weeks. These conversations helped each of us glean — or perhaps create — meaning in challenging, sometimes traumatic, experiences: the death of a child we’d cared for; abusive language from a superior; the guilt of committing a medical error. It was in these sessions that I chose my specialty, decided to apply to policy school, and vowed to reconnect with a lost friend. Meaning grows not just from conversation, of course, but also from action. One recent study randomly assigned 10th graders to volunteer weekly with elementary students — to help with homework, cooking, sports, or arts and crafts — or put them on a wait list. Teenagers who volunteered had lower levels of inflammation, better cholesterol profiles and lower body mass index. Those who had the biggest jumps in empathy and altruism scores had the largest reductions in cardiovascular risk. Engaging in these kinds of activities may be most important for individuals whose identity is in flux, like parents with children leaving for college or workers preparing for retirement. A program run by Experience Corps , an organization that trains older adults to tutor children in urban public schools, has shown marked improvements in mental and physical health among tutors. The improvements included higher self-esteem, more social connectedness, and better mobility and stamina. (The children do better, too.) This work hints at an underlying truth: Finding purpose is rarely an epiphany, nor is it something you pick up at the mall or download from the app store. It can be a long, arduous process that requires introspection and conversation, then a commitment to act. The key to a deeper, healthier life, it seems, isn&#x27;t knowing the meaning of life — it&#x27;s building meaning into your life. Even if meaning is a four-legged friend named Sadie. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

(The hugely controversial “correct” answer: octopuses.) Some questions (“Which retro fashion style did NOT make a comeback this year?”) basically test opinions. Others, which mine inconsequential information about obscure start-ups, stink strongly of advertorials. Then there’s the app itself, which is riddled with glitches and lags. Players are regularly booted from the game without explanation. The live host’s face is frequently obscured by the wheel of death. Sometimes, the whole game is scrapped for mysterious technical reasons — including one high-stakes game scheduled for 11:45 p.m. EST on New Year’s Eve, which was unceremoniously aborted, then rescheduled for 45 minutes later — the game I hopped into. And yet, as many as half a million people are tuning in for each session. It’s maybe the only real appointment viewing across all of entertainment right now. Why? HQ’s failures are, I believe, crucial to its appeal. Consider the warm sense of accomplishment you get from completing the crossword puzzle, which is meticulously crafted by professionals and is built on basically consistent branches of knowledge. HQ provides an even more beguiling sensation: the feeling of being aggrieved. The game pulls you in by dangling a cash prize, offers manic highs and seething frustrations in quick succession, then dumps you out, usually empty-handed. But the HQ refractory period — six to 18 hours — is just long enough to relax you into a state of optimism about playing again. It’s dystopian “Jeopardy!” : not the trivia game we wanted, but the one we deserve. HQ is based on an enticing proposition: It turns our phones, those founts of infinite knowledge, into a rare site of human recall. (Because questions are set on a 10-second clock, answers are generally un-Googleable .) But while the game purports to test legitimate knowledge, the questions are so frequently absurd that it comes closer to testing your undivided attention to mindless tapping. If you answer a question correctly, you still get that high of intellectual superiority. The Darwinian aspect — watch hundreds of thousands of people get eliminated as you rise — fosters a gleeful arrogance for as long as you’re on top. But when you get a question wrong, you’re granted plausible deniability. If you can’t finish the crossword, it feels like a personal failure. But when you lose HQ — which the vast majority of players do the vast majority of the time — it often seems arbitrary and unfair, the fault of the unskilled question writers or the unsophisticated technology. It’s not you. It’s the game . And even if you do win, the big-sounding prizes — $1,000, $2,000, $10,000 — are often reduced to pocket change when split among the sometimes hundreds of other people who also won the game. HQ is a little app that channels big feelings about the fundamental lie of the meritocracy. Every session becomes an opportunity to rail against life’s injustices. The avatar for all those feelings is Scott Rogowsky , the game’s usual host and its breakout star. Scott — players know him on a first-name basis — has been nicknamed “Quiz Daddy” by his fans. He calls his players “HQties.” On first viewing, Scott can come across as incredibly annoying. The moments in the game between the actual presentation of questions — when Scott is explaining the rules, making jokes, or dropping Phish references — can be excruciating. But after a few plays, Scott ingratiates himself into your psyche in a third-grade crush kind of way. Only after playing a game without Scott — a rotating crew of lackluster substitute hosts occasionally fills in — does his brilliance at his job become obvious: his unwavering eye contact; his punning proficiency; his confidence and coolness under pressure; his belief in himself, and in the game. Even when HQ crumbles, Scott is our rock. Scott’s folk hero status was cemented by yet another unforced error by the HQ team. When a reporter from The Daily Beast conducted an anodyne interview with Scott , Rus Yusupov, the co-founder and C.E.O., exploded at the “unauthorized” conversation, called the reporter and threatened to fire Scott if the story ran. The bizarre exchange only endeared players to Scott more. He may play our trivia overlord onscreen, but on some level, he, too, is a slave to HQ. Now whenever a not-Scott host appears, the chat that unspools beneath the game erupts in displeasure: “NOOOO.” “It’s not Scott.” “Where is Scott.” “Free Scott.” “#NOTMYHOST.” The chat is itself a fascinating artifact. When hundreds of thousands of people attempt to communicate at once, the only messages that scan are brief flashes of identity: “MAGA,” “OBAMA,” “BUSH DID 9/11,” “BUY DOGECOIN.” In the chat, griping about HQ has become as popular a pastime as actually playing the game. The slightest glitch produces a flurry of complaints like “LAG” and “NOT WORKING” and “WOW SCOTT.” Many of the game’s failings have crystallized into inside jokes. After incessant complaints of the app’s video stalling, Scott acquired a new nickname: “Lag Daddy.” The octopus question spawned its own in-game meme. Now the chat swims with octopus emoji. HQ’s most impressive achievement lies in its re-establishment of appointment viewing in the Netflix age. You can now watch pretty much any TV show or movie whenever you want, but when your phone buzzes with an HQ notification, you have only a few minutes to enter the game. If you miss the window, you’ll be forced to watch helplessly, tapping in vain, as it unfolds without you. HQ is a throwback to TV scheduling in the pre-DVR era, the digital equivalent of NBC’s Must-See TV lineup. (Scott is our Ross and our Rachel.) And the app has pulled it off by cultivating an unexpected sense of community amid the digital swamp. All the Darwinian competition, frustrating glitches and impossible questioning actually bring HQties together, bonding us through our performative trauma. The idea of actually downloading and playing the copycat app , “The Q,” is preposterous, even though its relatively minuscule traffic increases players’ chances of winning bigger sums. It’s not really about the money, after all. HQ has the power to create bonds outside the app, too. I won that New Year’s Eve game — I wrote this whole column so I could brag about that — but only because my dinner party happened to include representatives of the film industry (who knew that “Beauty and the Beast” was the second-largest-grossing movie of 2017), an actual rocket scientist (who knew that the technology used to peek inside the Great Pyramid of Giza involved subatomic muons), and me, a possessor of meaningless facts concerning Selena Gomez. We won $59.41, an unusually generous prize, and got digitally foisted onto the internet’s shoulders: I heard from a colleague, a Twitter follower, my friend’s mom. But when my phone buzzed the next day, summoning me to play again, it was as if a spell had been broken. I no longer feel the itch to play twice a day, at work and at dinner. I am free. Maybe I’ll check in from time to time, though. Just to see how Scott’s doing. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

One of the most influential such groups is the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest, or C.S.P.I., led for more than four decades by Michael Jacobson, who recently stepped down as executive director to work in semiretirement as a senior scientist. Inspired by Ralph Nader and armed with a degree in microbiology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dr. Jacobson and two co-founders burst onto the nutrition scene in 1971. Backed by the best scientific evidence of the day, C.S.P.I. relentlessly attacked the ingredients, marketing practices and dietary habits that research showed can undermine the health of Americans. With a natural bent as a communicator, Dr. Jacobson was able to sell serious science with catchy phrases and humor, alerting the public to foods to avoid and offering suggestions for more wholesome alternatives. Today, the organization’s Nutrition Action Healthletter still counters unwholesome products (it calls them “Food Porn”) with healthier options (“The Right Stuff”). In tackling the powerful soft drink industry, Dr. Jacobson memorably labeled sugar-sweetened sodas “liquid candy,” and C.S.P.I. fought to get “added sugars” listed as a separate item on the Nutrition Facts label. Now consumers can distinguish between sugars naturally present in fruits, vegetables and dairy products — and those sweeteners added in factories. Dr. Walter C. Willett, an internationally regarded researcher and professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said Americans would know a lot less about the foods they eat and how their health could suffer were it not for C.S.P.I. “Quite a bit of public dollars and scientific effort have demonstrated a clear relationship between diets and long-term health consequences,” Dr. Willett said. “The data are published and maybe reported in the news, but if that’s all that happens, the information is often forgotten. “If you really want to improve public health, it has to be translated into public policies, and that’s where C.S.P.I. has played such an important role.” The center has campaigned vigorously to rid foods of potentially hazardous food dyes; to get soda and junk food out of schools, and to include more vegetables and fruits in school lunches; to reduce trans fats in processed and restaurant-prepared foods to near zero; and to cut the amount of cardiovascular-damaging sodium in these foods. Thanks largely to C.S.P.I., food labels now list the seven most common food allergens, like peanuts or soy, which can be fatal to sensitive people. Now there are notices on alcoholic beverages warning of potential harm to an unborn child. The term organic now has a legal definition , and safety measures have been strengthened to prevent food-borne illness. As you might expect when a small nonprofit takes on a multi-billion-dollar industry, C.S.P.I. has not been free of controversy. Objections have been raised to the organization’s campaign to reduce dietary salt, for instance. Although some experts maintain salt is not a problem for most people, Dr. Jacobson believes that the best evidence says otherwise. “We advocate a public health approach and government intervention, while the conservative approach is personal responsibility and no government involvement,” he said in an interview. Dr. Willett noted, “Policy doesn’t happen in a vacuum, and an independent organization like C.S.P.I. is needed to counter the strong industry influence that seriously distorts nutritional science by influencing what research is done, what results get published and how the findings are slanted.” Dr. David Kessler, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and now a C.S.P.I. board member and professor at the University of California, San Francisco, said Dr. Jacobson “moved the country to demand healthier food. No single individual has done more. He converted an industry that initially was downright hostile to adopt nutritional values that have become mainstream.” Among his other achievements were creation in the mid-1970s of National Food Day, which inspired millions of young food activists, and a handbook called “Food for People, Not for Profit,” which explained issues like the role agribusiness plays in determining food quality. Equally impressive are Dr. Jacobson’s dependence on untainted scientific information and his willingness to amend his center’s advice when new evidence demands it. C.S.P.I. was accused of helping to create the trans fat problem when decades ago it pushed the food industry to substitute hydrogenated vegetable oils for highly saturated animal fats. “In the ‘70s and ’80s, there was no good evidence that trans fats were a problem,” Dr. Jacobson recalled. After reliable studies showed these fats were more damaging to cardiovascular health than beef and dairy fat, C.S.P.I. petitioned the F.D.A. in 1994 to label trans fats and championed their removal from commercially produced foods. Marion Nestle, emeritus professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, called C.S.P.I. “a unique organization with no conflicts of interest that is able to look at the whole big picture.” Its newsletter, she added, is “an extraordinary publication that over the years has covered every single issue in nutrition that anyone would care about. It boggles my mind that everyone doesn’t get it.” Full disclosure: I have been a decades-long fan of C.S.P.I. and subscriber to Nutrition Action Healthletter, and have given many friends and relatives gift subscriptions. From ice creams to meat substitutes, the newsletter helps take the guess work out of grocery shopping, ranking scores of commercial products as “best bites,” “honorable mentions” or simply “average,” according to nutritionally relevant contents like calories, sodium, sugar and protein. In a recent evaluation of commercial breads, the newsletter touted one — Dave’s Killer Bread Organic Thin-Sliced, loaded with whole grains and seeds and only 60 calories — that has become my absolute favorite. Every one of the 10 ad-free issues a year has nutritious, easy-to-prepare recipes, several of which have become household staples, like garlicky roasted chickpeas with cherry tomatoes and spicy roasted butternut squash. For consumers who often eat out or take out, the newsletter, guided by the extensive knowledge of the nutritionist Bonnie Liebman, suggests making more wholesome selections from among the usual offerings. At Panera, in lieu of an 840-calorie breakfast of a whole-grain bagel and cream cheese and 16-ounce caramel latte, the newsletter suggests an avocado, egg white and spinach breakfast sandwich on sprouted grain bagel flat and a latte with skim milk — for half the calories.

If one were to itemize the distinguishing characteristics of the novel itself, the list might include gruesomely macabre, intellectually ambitious and historically vivid. Not to mention totally unfilmable. A heady thrill ride with rich characters and an atmospheric Gilded Age New York setting, “The Alienist” begged for a Hollywood adaptation, and movie rights were sold for half a million dollars before the book was even published. But the intricate mystery proved too dense to distill into a satisfying film, though that didn’t stop producers from trying. “It’s been 25 years of battling against really bad interpretations of this book,” Mr. Carr said. But on Jan. 22, “The Alienist” finally comes to screens on TNT, because of a fortuitous convergence of factors: a resurrected television studio looking to mine its rights library; a cable channel angling for more prestige; and an emerging program format — the limited series — that accommodates both ambitious, season-long narratives and actors who wouldn’t sign on for television’s usual multiyear commitments. The 10-episode season will present, from start to finish, the book’s story of Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, a brilliant, prickly psychiatrist — or alienist, in the parlance of the day — and his team of cohorts tracking a killer who preys on boy prostitutes in the vice-ridden city. The German actor Daniel Brühl (“Rush”) stars as the titular doctor, with Dakota Fanning (“American Pastoral”) and Luke Evans (“Beauty and the Beast”) rounding out the leads. Mr. Carr said the past film attempts failed because producers like Scott Rudin sought to turn his layered psychological tale into a more conventionally formatted blockbuster, proposing to cut characters, add a love story and otherwise abandon the main focus on the team tracking the murderer. “If you don’t get what the central dynamic of a book is, you’re not going to be able to make a good movie out of it,” Mr. Carr said. (“I wish him well with the show,” Mr. Rudin emailed in response.) For all his exasperation, Mr. Carr remained eager for an adaptation “that enough resembled the book that I didn’t have to fight that battle anymore,” so he could move forward with the next chapter of the saga. He is now working on the third book in the series, “The Alienist at Armageddon,” slated to arrive in September . (The second, “The Angel of Darkness,” came out in 1997.) “It seemed like a really futile struggle to continue the series when there was no interest in making a decent product out of the first book, much less the second book, much less a future book,” Mr. Carr said. That pessimism lifted after the television arm of Paramount, which held the movie rights, was revived in 2013. “The Alienist” was “literally the first book I took off the shelf,” said Amy Powell, the studio’s president. For TNT, still best known for procedurals and ampersands — “Rizzoli &amp; Isles,” “Franklin &amp; Bash,” “Law &amp; Order” reruns — “The Alienist” heralds a new focus on shows “that engage people more, that have a stronger, deeper pull on them,” said Sarah Aubrey, TNT’s executive vice president for original programming. In the past few years, the network has forged a new path under the president Kevin Reilly , with more provocative series like “Animal Kingdom” and “Claws.” But “The Alienist” represents its biggest swing yet. It is the most expensive show the network has produced, Ms. Aubrey confirmed, though she wouldn’t say how much “The Alienist” cost. ( Variety reported that TNT was paying $5 million per episode.) Set mostly in 1896, the series was shot in Budapest on an elaborate ersatz fin de siècle Manhattan set that was designed to allow 360-degree movement of the cameras and actors, where designers obsessed over not just cobblestone streets, costumes and gas lamps but also pocket watches, hairpins and shop windows. “Every detail matters,” said Jakob Verbruggen (“The Fall”), a director and executive producer of the series. “We could only sell this world if we made it 100 percent believable.” Such historical specificity was a big part of what captivated readers of “The Alienist,” which unfolds in a grimy New York teeming with beleaguered immigrants, sordid brothels, crooked cops and uptown oligarchs, and included real-world figures like Theodore Roosevelt, then a police commissioner, and the financier J.P. Morgan. The philosophical question at its dark heart — is evil born or bred? — is debated throughout by the agreeably ragtag group pursuing the killer, which in addition to the alienist includes a crime reporter for The New York Times; a police secretary who was the department’s first female employee; and two quirky detective brothers. Their innovative tactics include what we now recognize as criminal profiling, fingerprinting and forensic science. Though the series is faithful to the team dynamic that animates the novel, there are differences. The killer’s perspective, absent from the book, is introduced early in the series. The reporter character, played by Mr. Evans, is now an illustrator. Sara Howard, the secretary played by Ms. Fanning, has been broadened into a fuller portrait of a young woman trying to be tough enough to thrive in a man’s world without losing her femininity and sexuality, Ms. Fanning said. “As women, I think that’s something we all deal with and especially right now, it’s being talked about a lot,” she added, alluding to the ongoing national reckoning with toxic male behavior . Ms. Powell said, “When people see it, I think it will be even more relevant than we thought it was when we were working on it.” Additional modern resonance can be found in the book’s story of forgotten refugees seeking better lives in a new country and in the economic chasm between its impoverished New Yorkers and privileged ones. “You can parallel it almost perfectly to certain societies we know today,” Mr. Evans said. “It’s very topical, and I think people will talk about it a lot and make the comparisons.” But what does the toughest critic of all say about “The Alienist”? Mr. Carr sounded annoyed that his being named a consulting producer meant little in practice. “My contribution was neither sought or when it was volunteered, paid attention to,” he said. But he had no complaints that the project’s original main creative force, Cary Fukunaga ( “Beasts of No Nation,” “True Detective”), left “The Alienist” before filming started. His take on the story was too salacious and “nearly completely mistaken,” Mr. Carr said. (The reason given by the studio for his departure, then and now, was that production delays led to conflicts with his other commitments. Mr. Fukunaga, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, remains credited as an executive producer and is currently working on another Paramount series, an adaptation of the Norwegian comedy “Maniac” for Netflix. “Cary put a huge fingerprint on the project,” Ms. Powell said.) Mr. Carr also said he liked much of the pilot, the only episode he’s watched, praising in particular the visuals and performances by Mr. Brühl and Mr. Evans. Finally seeing his most famous story onscreen, after decades of starts, stops and misfires, brought a sense of bifurcation, he said, as he separated his author self from his viewer one in an effort to assess the series’s chances in an overstuffed TV universe. But it brought no relief, at least not yet. “I’ll feel a sense of relief if it succeeds,” he said. “If it doesn’t, it’s just further frustration.” ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

I’m 88, and between 1930 and 1948 went from newborn to adult, from toddler to leader of an infantry squad. Those first 18 years were a journey into manhood, while the millennium seems merely its epilogue. I’m certainly not the same man at 88 I was when the millennium began. But changes in me — stiffness, skin that invites angry bruises, occasional memory lapses — are insignificant compared to the growth spurt at 17 that shot me from 5-foot-8 to 6-foot-2. I hope I’ve gained additional wisdom during the millennium, but feel I’m essentially the same man I was 18 years ago. That contrast came into sharp focus recently when I renewed my driver’s license. A motor vehicle clerk, glancing from me to the photograph taken seven years earlier, said I hadn’t changed enough to require a new picture. So little physical change in seven years! Only my mother would have recognized me in photographs taken seven years apart during my first 18 years of life. Aging has put me on a conveyor propelling me through days as though there were only two in a month, the first and the last. Daily rituals like shaving, brushing my teeth, dressing have me puzzling, didn’t I just do this? I sometimes think of time as slices of a pie. Summers were endless when I was 6, just as one-sixth of a pie is a generous portion. Even with a scalpel and hands steadier than mine, cutting a pie into 88 slices is beyond most of us. That thought alone reminds me that the slice of life remaining to me is very small. I’m aware I should be grateful the days are rushing by for me. I have ill friends in almost constant discomfort who describe their days as “unending” and “hard to fill.” One recently told me, “Time goes about as fast as I can push this walker.” Knowing I’m a stumble away from a walker of my own has me examining how I spend the days left to me. That is more difficult than it seems as my mind often resembles a theater, transforming the most casual stroll into a play noisy with dialogue. Does the girl texting as she hurries forward realize she’s going to plow into me? Are there enough hedge-fund managers to fill all the apartment buildings shooting skyward around me? Which is more likely to hit me as I cross this street, a taxi or a bike? Hardest for me is reflecting quietly on the path I’ve taken to where I have yet to go. I know I have to make some profound changes in my behavior if I am to recapture the adventure and passion I experienced during the first 18 years of my life. That means being willing at 88 to acknowledge I have to break habits that are comfortable but confining. The place to begin was the theater of my mind. I read of a brain training center that treats children with behavioral problems and adults entering dementia. I called and asked if their neurofeedback program could help a healthy brain achieve a better balance between the noisy frequencies that fill my mind with chatter and the quieter, more calming ones. They said it might, and I decided to participate in a few sessions. I followed a therapist to a soundproofed room, where electrodes were attached to various parts of my head and connected to a computer that measured the electrical patterns of my brain. The therapist’s objective was to invigorate neurons that were less active — the rarely quiet part of my brain — while dimming those firing more vigorously. After six sessions, I had no idea if my mind attained a healthy equilibrium between chatter and calm. I do know I emerged determined to find in my daily life the tranquillity I experienced in that room. While I’ve meditated for years, the peace I feel during 30 minutes of mindfulness is quickly eclipsed by noise in the street and in my head. I had to begin replacing the dramas playing in my mind with the quiet needed to reflect on how I was going to spend the time remaining to me. I’m trying to break other habits in far more conventional ways. As in many long marriages, my wife and I enjoy spending time with the same friends, watch the same television programs, favor the same restaurants, schedule vacations to many of the same places, avoid activities that venture too far from the familiar. We decided to become more adventurous, shedding some of those habits. European friends of ours always seem to find the time for an afternoon coffee or glass of wine, something we never did. Now, spontaneously, one of us will suggest going to a coffee shop or cafe just to talk, and we do. It’s hardly a lifestyle revolution, but it does encourage us to examine everything we do automatically, and brings some freshness to a marriage that started when Dwight Eisenhower was elected president. My fitness regimen had also become habitual: treadmill, swimming, core exercises and resistance training. Watching others work out in different ways tempted me to vary that routine. When I read about a rehabilitation program designed for a New York Giant defensive lineman who had mangled his hand, it made me wonder if I could ask new things of my body. The gym he went to was near my home, and I arranged a meeting with his trainer and asked if he could design a far less rigorous program for me. He added exercises I had never attempted, pedaling and running in brief bursts of intensity, lifting weights while balancing on one foot, focusing more on reaching and lifting movements that mimic the functions of everyday life, countering the stiffness accompanying aging by stretching, bending and leaping. The workout I now follow is mentally and physically taxing but within the capabilities of someone my age, and I regard it as part of my intention to ask more of my mind and body in these remaining years. None of these efforts to break old habits will add one day to my life. But I feel I’ve stepped off the conveyor and am experiencing some of the passion and adventure I felt in the first 18 years of my life. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

Don’t waste time being hard on yourself. It’s often the case that someone who has decided to switch fields entirely must overcome the urge to delay making such a big move. And sure, in retrospect, you probably should have trusted your instinct and ignored everyone else. But that’s hindsight. It’s often good to get the advice of others who know you and your situation and who might be able to offer a useful perspective. Maybe you would have regretted it if you hadn’t given the new position a shot. Who knows? The point is that now you know: Taking the promotion was a mistake. Not only are you unhappy, but it sounds like your supervisor and your family aren’t pleased, either. Why prolong this a single minute longer than necessary? If you’re really ready to jump to a new path , get on with it! To answer questions about a short stint on your résumé, just tell the truth, but with a forward-looking focus: You had been planning this change for a while and delayed it when you were offered a promotion. But that has only underscored your certainty that it’s time to move on, and you’re way more excited about what lies ahead in your new chosen field. Don’t dwell on the problems of the past or present. Employers really aren’t that interested in why you want to quit your job; they’re interested in finding the best person to fill whatever opening they have. Keep the emphasis on what you want to do next — and why anyone who hires you to do that won’t regret it. Ouch. This is a great (by which I mean awful) example of how a logically sound decision can turn out to be the wrong move. I still believe you have every right to opt out of extracurricular job-related spending that doesn’t make sense to you — but you do have to judge what that might cost you in the long run, which will vary by workplace. In this case, with only a couple days on the job, that would have been hard to deduce. Maybe it’s worth amending the Workologist stance to advise that if you’re still acclimating to a new gig, you should consider playing along with the apparent norms until you feel confident about the office culture. But this also underscores the need for managers to make sure such activities are coordinated thoughtfully. Surely your bosses did not want a goodbye lunch to make a new employee feel ostracized.

Scientists at George Mason University have improved by at least 100 times the accuracy of testing for a sugar shed by tuberculosis bacteria, meaning that a simple dipstick urine test may soon become possible. The researchers’ study was published last month in Science Translational Medicine. Tuberculosis kills about 1.7 million people a year, according to the World Health Organization — more than are killed now by AIDS . While many people carry inactive bacteria, about 10 million fall ill annually and develop coughs that transmit the infection. If they could be found and treated sooner, more would be cured and the spread would slow. For decades, tuberculosis was diagnosed by chest X-rays, skin or blood tests, or by reading sputum samples under a microscope. But the W.H.O. has condemned skin and blood tests as inaccurate , X-rays detect only advanced damage, and microscopy requires trained pathologists. Since 2010, detection has been revolutionized by GeneXpert machines , which take two hours to make the diagnosis. They not only find bacterial DNA in sputum but can tell if the strain is impervious to a common antibiotic, which suggests that the patient has multi-drug-resistant disease. But the machines are expensive, even at discounts offered to poor countries, and it is hard for weak patients and children to hock up lung mucus. (Some clinics have sealed “ cough rooms ” where salt mist is blown deep into lungs to trigger coughing fits.) Urine is easier to obtain. The cell walls of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are studded with lipoarabinomannan glycans — sugars coupled to proteins, forming barriers that are believed to protect the bacterium from the immune system. In the battle, the sugars are shed into the bloodstream and slip through the kidneys into urine. Until recently, it has been hard to separate them from other cellular debris, but the researchers designed hydrogel “nanocages” baited with a blue copper-based dye that adheres tightly to the sugars. In tests on about 100 hospitalized Peruvians, half of whom were known to have tuberculosis, the new test proved about as accurate as GeneXpert machines, said Alessandra Luchini , a nanoparticle scientist at George Mason’s molecular biology center and co-author of the study. (The new test, however, does not measure drug resistance.) The team hopes to adapt the new technique to clamp onto other tuberculosis-related molecules and come up “with a rapid test similar to a pregnancy test,” Dr. Luchini said. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

Want this in your own email inbox ? Here’s the sign-up . Last year’s rally has shown few signs of slowing down in 2018. If anything, the record run in stocks appears to be gaining momentum. The Dow Jones industrial average just recorded its best start to the year since 2003, reports the WSJ . Having just surpassed 25,000 on Thursday, the blue-chip is already more than a quarter of the way to 26,000. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index rose 2.6 percent after posting four straight records during the holiday-shortened week. That was its best start to a year since 2006. Tech stocks surged 4.2 percent to begin the New Year. Fourth-quarter earnings season kicks off next week with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and BlackRock all reporting Friday. Here’s what Wall Street analysts are expecting, courtesy of FactSet. • Analysts expect companies in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index to report profits rose 10.5 percent from a year ago, according to FactSet. • All 11 sectors are forecast to report earnings growth. • The index’s energy companies are expected to show the biggest jump, up 132 percent. That increase is largely a result of the continued rebound in oil prices. The two-year free-fall in oil prices that began in 2014 decimated the bottom line of energy companies, but since the second half of last year, the sector’s profits have been rebounding. • If analysts forecast for earnings prove correct, it will mark the third quarter in the past four that the S.&amp;P. 500 has posted double-digit gains in earnings. • Sales are forecast to grow 6.7 percent. Most Federal Reserve officials expect to raise rates three times this year. A number of private economists, including Goldman Sachs’s Jan Hatzius, are forecasting four. The market, meanwhile, has priced in only two. The Fed, though, could surprise investors to the upside, writes Christopher Beddor of Breakingviews. Mr. Beddor added: Recode’s Peter Kafka reports that “Stefan Blom, Spotify’s chief content officer, announced his departure via an internal memo Friday.” The NYT and others reported earlier this week that Spotify had filed confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in the first quarter of this year. Via Recode: • F.B.I. agents have renewed asking questions about the dealings of the Clinton Foundation amid calls from President Trump and top Republicans for the Justice Department to take a fresh look at politically charged accusations of corruption.

( NYT ) • The nation’s political and financial capitals have never felt so far apart. Washington is kicking off the new year with a fresh round of Trump-fueled chaos. On Wall Street, meanwhile, the sky hardly seems the limit. ( WaPo ) • Gary Cohn told Bloomberg TV that the Trump administration may try to block potential plans by high-tax states including New York and California to shield residents from state and local tax break changes.

Here are some items you can buy from Berkshire businesses for the price of one A share. ( MoneyBeat ) The headline number of 148,000 jobs added came in well below the 198,000 expected by Wall Street economists. But don’t read too much into the miss. The trend remains strong. The United States economy has added jobs for 87 straight months, an unparalleled run, and the unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low. On top of all that, the number may be revised upward in the coming months. Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, writes : But this jobs report was all about wages, and growth there remained lackluster. Year over year, earnings increased by around 2.5 percent. “We expect a clear upturn over the first half of this year, but it isn’t happening yet,” wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics. This mysterious lack of earnings growth has helped provide cover for Federal Reserve officials to slowly raise rates. So what does this mean to the Fed’s rate plan? “At the margin, this report reduces the odds of a March rate hike, but two more reports are due before the FOMC meeting, by which time these numbers will be ancient history,” wrote Mr. Shepherdson. Fitbit is investing $6 million into Sano, which is developing a patch to track a person’s blood sugar level, reported Christina Farr of CNBC. The move could help Fitbit reverse declining sales. Via CNBC: Keeping pace with Apple: Last month The New York Times reported that device manufacturers are tapping into new features on the Apple Watch to develop medical accessories. Apple is also looking for its own medical breakthroughs, such as a noninvasive continuous glucose reader, the NYT reported. David Tepper of Appaloosa Management thinks so , telling CNBC: A dissenting voice: The market historian James Stack told Jim Stewart of the NYT: “ A correction would be healthy . The longer we go without one, the greater the risk this will end badly. A lot of people will get hurt.” The next thing to look out for: It’s Jobs Friday today. A Reuters survey of economists expects the nonfarm payroll report to show a gain of 190,000 for December. Legal experts are poring over the question, after a report by Mike Schmidt of the NYT that President Trump told the White House’s top lawyer to stop Jeff Sessions recusing himself from the Russia investigation. From Mr. Schmidt’s story: About that Michael Wolff book: “Fire and Fury” is to go on sale today, ahead of schedule — and despite legal threats from Mr. Trump . So a steady drip of excerpts — from Steve Bannon calling a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russians “treasonous” to the former adviser suggesting that money laundering charges were in the offing — is about to become a flood. The most damaging may be the book’s descriptions of Mr. Trump’s erratic behavior and of aides’ private contempt for their boss. Many Washington reads are underway (you start in the index, looking for your name). The firestorm has also propelled Mr. Wolff from local media gadfly into national newsmaker . The fallout for Mr. Bannon: Rebekah Mercer, the adviser’s longtime benefactor, disavowed him in a rare public statement. And Breitbart’s board members have debated whether to oust him as the media organization’s chairman, according to the WSJ, citing unnamed sources. About that money-laundering accusation: Tim O’Brien of Bloomberg View says that Mr. Bannon’s allegation is as serious as any claim of “treason.” The Washington flyaround • Mr. Trump may have dismantled his voter fraud commission, but he wasn’t happy about it.

Yes, corporations like Apple will have to repatriate overseas earnings under the new code. And the tax analyst David Zion estimates that they will pay some $235 billion. But he also reckons that the new repatriation treatment alone is worth $500 billion more compared with the old law. And analysts in general think the overhaul will help corporate America . As J. Richard Harvey, a Villanova law professor, told Jesse Drucker of the NYT, multinationals have sought a change like this for over a decade: Energy companies, obviously.

But a few decades ago American health care spending was much closer to that of peer nations. What happened? A large part of the answer can be found in the title of a 2003 paper in Health Affairs by the Princeton University health economist Uwe Reinhardt: “ It’s the prices, stupid. ” The study, also written by Gerard Anderson, Peter Hussey and Varduhi Petrosyan, found that people in the United States typically use about the same amount of health care as people in other wealthy countries do, but pay a lot more for it. Ashish Jha, a physician with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, studies how health systems from various countries compare in terms of prices and health care use. “What was true in 2003 remains so today,” he said. “The U.S. just isn’t that different from other developed countries in how much health care we use. It is very different in how much we pay for it.” A recent study in JAMA by scholars from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle and the U.C.L.A. David Geffen School of Medicine also points to prices as a likely culprit. Their study spanned 1996 to 2013 and analyzed U.S. personal health spending by the size of the population; its age; and the amount of disease present in it. They also examined how much health care we use in terms of such things as doctor visits, days in the hospital and prescriptions. They looked at what happens during those visits and hospital stays (called care intensity), combined with the price of that care. The researchers looked at the breakdown for 155 different health conditions separately. Since their data included only personal health care spending, it did not account for spending in the health sector not directly attributed to care of patients, like hospital construction and administrative costs connected to running Medicaid and Medicare. Over all, the researchers found that American personal health spending grew by about $930 billion between 1996 and 2013, from $1.2 trillion to $2.1 trillion (amounts adjusted for inflation). This was a huge increase, far outpacing overall economic growth. The health sector grew at a 4 percent annual rate, while the overall economy grew at a 2.4 percent rate. You’d expect some growth in health care spending over this span from the increase in population size and the aging of the population. But that explains less than half of the spending growth. After accounting for those kinds of demographic factors, which we can do very little about, health spending still grew by about $574 billion from 1996 to 2013. Did the increasing sickness in the American population explain much of the rest of the growth in spending? Nope. Measured by how much we spend, we’ve actually gotten a bit healthier. Change in health status was associated with a decrease in health spending — 2.4 percent — not an increase. A great deal of this decrease can be attributed to factors related to cardiovascular diseases, which were associated with about a 20 percent reduction in spending. This could be a result of greater use of statins for cholesterol or reduced smoking rates, though the study didn’t point to specific causes. On the other hand, increases in diabetes and low back and neck pain were associated with spending growth, but not enough to offset the decrease from cardiovascular and other diseases. Did we spend more time in the hospital? No, though we did have more doctor visits and used more prescription drugs. These tend to be less costly than hospital stays, so, on balance, changes in health care use were associated with a minor reduction (2.5 percent) in health care spending. That leaves what happens during health care visits and hospital stays (care intensity) and the price of those services and procedures. Did we do more for patients in each health visit or inpatient stay? Did we charge more? The JAMA study found that, together, these accounted for 63 percent of the increase in spending from 1996 to 2013. In other words, most of the explanation for American health spending growth — and why it has pulled away from health spending in other countries — is that more is done for patients during hospital stays and doctor visits, they’re charged more per service, or both. Though the JAMA study could not separate care intensity and price, other research blames prices more. For example, one study found that the spending growth for treating patients between 2003 and 2007 is almost entirely because of a growth in prices, with little contribution from growth in the quantity of treatment services provided. Another study found that U.S. hospital prices are 60 percent higher than those in Europe. Other studies also point to prices as a major factor in American health care spending growth. There are ways to combat high health care prices. One is an all-payer system , like that seen in Maryland. This regulates prices so that all insurers and public programs pay the same amount. A single-payer system could also regulate prices. If attempted nationally, or even in a state, either of these would be met with resistance from all those who directly benefit from high prices, including physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies — and pretty much every other provider of health care in the United States. Higher prices aren’t all bad for consumers. They probably lead to some increased innovation , which confers benefits to patients globally. Though it’s reasonable to push back on high health care prices, there may be a limit to how far we should. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

Speaking on the “Today” show, Michael Wolff, the author of “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” called the administration’s attempt to block the book “extraordinary” and dismissed the president’s criticisms of him out of hand. “My credibility is being questioned by a man who has less credibility than, perhaps, anyone who has ever walked on earth at this point,” Mr. Wolff said. In a tweet late on Thursday, Mr. Trump claimed that he had not authorized Mr. Wolff’s access to the White House (and in fact had turned him down) and that he had never spoken to the author for the book. Mr. Wolff countered by saying that he had absolutely spoken to the president and had done so after the inauguration. “Whether he realized it was an interview or not, I don’t know, but it certainly was not off the record,” he said. He said that, cumulatively, he had spent about three hours with the president during the campaign and in the White House. “What was I doing there if he didn’t want me to be there?” he said. Excerpts from “Fire and Fury” began to appear online earlier this week, leading to a break between Mr. Trump and his onetime chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, who is quoted in the book calling Donald Trump Jr.’s actions during the campaign “treasonous” and “unpatriotic” and insulting Ivanka Trump. Mr. Wolff characterized the book as an investigation of what it was like to work with Mr. Trump. He wrote that the president’s associates called him a “moron” and an “idiot,” and almost unanimously described him as being “like a child.” “What they mean by that is he has a need for immediate gratification,” Mr. Wolff said. “It’s all about him.” On Thursday, a lawyer for the president sent an 11-page letter to the book’s publisher, Henry Holt and Co., saying that it included false statements about the president that “give rise to claims of libel.” In reaction, the publisher moved up the release date. Originally scheduled for a Tuesday debut, “Fire and Fury” was made available early Friday morning. “We see ‘Fire and Fury’ as an extraordinary contribution to our national discourse, and are proceeding with the publication of the book,” the publisher said in a statement. The White House has characterized the book as a “complete fantasy” full of “tabloid gossip,” but it is not only the administration that has questioned Mr. Wolff’s reporting. Some journalists have also expressed skepticism and pointed to past criticism of Mr. Wolff’s work. In 2004, The New Republic said the scenes in his columns “aren’t recreated so much as created — springing from Wolff’s imagination rather than from actual knowledge of events.” Others have said that the book, while filled with new and lurid details, corroborates previous reporting about the Trump White House. Writing in The Atlantic on Thursday , James Fallows, a former Carter administration official and prominent critic of Mr. Trump, called the book’s details “unforgettable and potentially historic.” “We’ll see how many of them fully stand up, and in what particulars, but even at a heavy discount, it’s a remarkable tale,” he said. Mr. Wolff chose to sidestep broader questions about his credibility on “Today,” claiming that he had written “millions” of words in his career and had never received a correction. Instead, he kept his attention fixed on a president whose opposition to his book has only heightened its profile. Asked how he felt about the president’s attempt to keep the book off shelves, Mr. Wolff quipped, “Where do I send the box of chocolates?” ', 0, 0, 5, 1);

(657, 5, 'Your Money Adviser: Count Bank Overdraft Fees as a Holiday Expense, Too', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/your-money/bank-overdraft-fees.html?partner=rss&emc=rss', '2018-01-05 18:51:11', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png', 'Consumers struggling with holiday spending hangovers may want to reconsider resorting to overdrafts on their checking accounts. Banks often market overdraft programs as a way for customers to smooth out occasional budgeting problems. But many consumers don’t understand how they work and end up using overdrafts as a kind of high-cost credit, according to a new report from the Pew Charitable Trusts . An overdraft occurs when you spend more than you have in your checking account, but your bank allows the payment to go through, and charges you a fee. The fees vary, but big banks typically charge about $35. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently estimated that consumers pay $17 billion in such fees each year. Banks’ overdraft revenue tends to rise each quarter of the calendar year before dropping again in the first quarter, suggesting that consumers may be crunched for cash and particularly vulnerable to such fees at the end of the year, said Thaddeus King, an officer with Pew’s consumer finance project. The federal government requires consumers to give permission by “opting in” to overdraft coverage for debit card purchases and automated teller machine withdrawals. If they don’t opt in, and they attempt a debit card purchase or A.T.M. withdrawal that exceeds their balance, the transaction is declined, without a fee. But many consumers — nearly three in four, according to Pew’s finding — don’t realize that they have a choice. Among those who have overdrawn their accounts in the past 12 months, Pew found, more than half are “heavy” overdrafters, who have done it at least three times. Customers’ understanding of how overdraft coverage works is low, even among those who have spoken to their bank about it, the report found. That suggests that banks’ communication about overdraft programs is ineffective, according to the report. Customers “don’t seem to understand that when you opt out, you don’t pay the fee,” Mr. King said. He called the finding “somewhat disheartening.” Pew suggested that many consumers would benefit if banks were instead able to offer lower-cost, small-installment loans with clear rules to protect borrowers. Such loans could be safely made if they were capped at 5 percent of the borrower’s paycheck, Pew said. Many banks and credit unions have said they would be open to making such loans if they were given clear guidelines from regulators, Mr. King said. The Pew report, published in December, was based on a telephone survey in April and May of more than 1,000 adults who reported paying an overdraft fee in the prior year. Here are some questions and answers about bank overdraft fees: How can I avoid overdraft fees? Consumer advocates often advise against agreeing to overdraft fees. If you don’t opt in and you make a purchase with your debit card that would overdraw your account, the purchase will simply be declined and banks can’t charge you a fee. Consumer Reports notes that some big banks — like Bank of America and Chase — have “lower risk” accounts that don’t offer overdraft coverage. It’s also worth asking about other consumer-friendly policies when shopping for a bank account. Some banks waive fees on small overdrafts — say, $10 or less. Consumers can change their minds and drop overdraft coverage at any time, according to the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group for retail banks. If you do choose coverage, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau suggests setting up low-balance alerts on your account so that you receive a text or email when your account drops below a certain level. Also, most banks now offer smartphone apps that make it easy to check your balance before making a purchase so you can hold off if funds are tight. You can also set up an overdraft transfer by linking your checking account to a savings account; funds will be automatically transferred when you overspend. You may still pay a transfer fee, but it’s usually less than an overdraft fee. Can I decline overdraft coverage when writing checks? No. Banks don’t need your permission to charge you a fee for overspending your account because of a check or for some other transactions, like recurring debit transactions and some electronic payments. Are there efforts to make bank overdraft policies more understandable? Last summer, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau began testing new overdraft explanation documents, with the goal of helping bank customers better evaluate their options. It’s not clear if or when the bureau will formally propose that banks use the forms. You can see the prototypes , however, on the agency’s website. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

For Older Adults, the Dutch Have a Cure', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/world/europe/netherlands-falling-elderly.html?partner=rss&emc=rss', '2018-01-03 03:58:29', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/04/world/europe/Falling-Promo/xxFalling-slide-4LEN-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'LEUSDEN, Netherlands — The shouts of schoolchildren playing outside echoed through the gymnasium where an obstacle course was being set up. There was the “Belgian sidewalk,” a wooden contraption designed to simulate loose tiles; a “sloping slope,” ramps angled at an ankle-unfriendly 45 degrees; and others like “the slalom” and “the pirouette.” They were not for the children, though, but for a class where the students ranged in age from 65 to 94. The obstacle course was clinically devised to teach them how to navigate treacherous ground without having to worry about falling, and how to fall if they did. “It’s not a bad thing to be afraid of falling, but it puts you at higher risk of falling,” said Diedeke van Wijk, a physiotherapist who runs WIJKfysio and teaches the course three times a year in Leusden, a bedroom community just outside Amersfoort, in the center of the country. The Dutch, like many elsewhere, are living longer than in previous generations, often alone. As they do, courses that teach them not only how to avoid falling, but how to fall correctly, are gaining popularity. This one, called Vallen Verleden Tijd course, roughly translates as “Falling is in the past.” Hundreds of similar courses are taught by registered by physio- and occupational therapists across the Netherlands. Yet falling courses — especially clinically tested ones — are a fairly recent phenomenon, according to Richard de Ruiter, of the Sint Maartenskliniek in Nijmegen, the foundation hospital that developed this particular course. Virtually unheard-of just a decade ago, the courses are now common enough that the government rates them . Certain forms of Dutch health insurance even cover part of the costs. While the students are older, not all of them seemed particularly frail. Herman van Lovink, 88, arrived on his bike. So did Annie Houtveen, 75. But some arrived with walkers and canes, and others were carefully guided by relatives. Falling can be a serious thing for older adults. Aging causes the bones to become brittle, and broken ones do not heal as readily. Today, 18.5 percent of the Dutch population — roughly 3.2 million people — is 65 or older, according to official statistics . In 1950, about the time some of the younger course participants were born, people 65 or older made up just 7.7 percent of the population. Across the Netherlands, 3,884 people 65 or older died as result of a fall in 2016, a 38 percent increase from two years earlier. Experts say the rise in fatalities reflects the overall aging of the population, and also factors such as the growing use of certain medications or general inactivity. “It’s same as with young children: More and more old people have an inactive lifestyle,” said Saskia Kloet, a program manager at VeiligheidNL, an institution that offers similar courses. Even inactivity in one’s 30s or 40s could lead to problems later in life, she noted. Like many people her age, Hans Kuhn, 85, worried that her daily routine — and the ability to live alone — would end if she ever lost her balance and fell. She has lived in her house for decades, and alone since her partner died years ago. Its steeply winding staircase is equipped with a motorized chair on a rail to help reach upper floors. “I only use it when I have to bring lots of heavy things upstairs,” said Ms. Kuhn, herself a retired physiotherapist. Ms. Kuhn’s entire house is a study in efficiency and simple modifications that can make all the difference for an older person. Hand grips are installed in just the right places, as well as ramps to accommodate her two walkers. There is a stationary exercise bike to keep her moving, and a weight machine made from a big can of beans and string to maintain her upper body strength. Even as she feels herself grow frailer and less flexible, she knows how to stay fit. “My main problem is I’m very afraid of falling,” she said. So she joined the course, which meets twice a week. On Tuesdays, the students build confidence by walking and re-walking the obstacle course. Thursdays are reserved for the actual falls. In order to learn, the students start by approaching the mats slowly, lowering themselves down at first. Over the weeks, they learn to fall. “Naturally, they are not interested in courses on falling at first, but once they see that they can do it, then it’s fun,” Ms. Kloet said. “But there is also a very important social aspect.” Indeed, seeing one another helplessly sprawled across the gym mats gave way to giggling and plenty of dry comments, knowing jokes, general ribbing and hilarity. “Stop your chattering,” Ms. van Wijk warned a group of well-dressed women who were supposed to be concentrating on the correct way to let themselves fall onto the foot-thick blue mat. “I would,” said Loes Bloemdal, 80, laughing. “But I have no one to talk with all day.” In preparing their bodies for a possibly apocalyptic event, the students appeared to forget about their age. Mr. van Lovink, the cyclist, asked if they would learn standing on one leg. “Why would you want to do that?” replied Ms. van Wijk. “To be able to put on my pants,” Mr. van Lovink said seriously, but to the amusement of his classmates. Ms. van Wijk advised them all to always sit when putting on their pants. “That’s the power of physiotherapy with geriatrics,” she said. “You practice the things you know you can do, and not the things you can’t.” ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

But in New York City today, heavy taxes have pushed that price north of $13 . Even adjusted for inflation, that’s more than a fivefold increase. In the intervening years, we have also banned smoking in restaurants, bars and public buildings. Some jurisdictions have prohibited smoking even in outdoor public spaces. We have spent billions of dollars on media campaigns to discourage smoking. Given the longstanding American hostility to social engineering, each of these steps faced heavy pushback. When called on to justify them, regulators have offered their traditional response: Restricting individual freedom is often the only way to prevent undue harm to innocent bystanders. The specific harm cited has almost always been well-documented health hazards caused by secondhand smoke. This rationale is similar to the one for requiring catalytic converters on cars: We need them to prevent pollution that would otherwise cause undue harm to others. But unless you work in a crowded bar with no ventilation, the health risks from secondhand smoke are small compared with those from being a smoker. For example, more than 85 percent of American deaths from lung cancer are attributable to smoking, with fewer than one-third of the remainder linked to passive smoke exposure. Regulators may insist that their aim is not to protect smokers from themselves, but our regulations do vastly more to protect smokers (by inducing them to quit) than to protect bystanders. In fact, smoking also harms bystanders in a more important way: Each person who becomes a smoker makes it more likely that others will become smokers as well. This additional effect outweighs the harm caused by secondhand smoke by enough to suggest that our efforts to discourage smoking, strict as they seem, may not be nearly strict enough. Some are more sensitive than others to environmental influences. I have four adult sons, none of whom is a smoker. I once remarked to a friend that if they had grown up when I did, at least two of them would be. My son Chris, who was present during this conversation, immediately asked, “Which two?” “David (my oldest) almost certainly would have been,” I said, “and Hayden (my youngest) probably would have been, too.” I added that Jason wouldn’t have smoked no matter when he had been born. Chris seemed offended, insisting that he, too, probably would have become a smoker if he had grown up when I did. When I started smoking at age 14 in 1959, many of my friends had already been smoking for several years. My parents didn’t want me to smoke, but as smokers themselves, they were poorly positioned to object. In those days, more than 60 percent of American men were smokers, and almost as many women. Smoking was just something that most people did. Yet even then, people who smoked did not seem happy about it. Today, roughly 90 percent of smokers say they regret having started, and about 80 percent express a desire to quit. Some 40 to 50 percent of smokers try to quit each year , but fewer than 5 percent of them succeed. Several of my own attempts to quit failed. So I count myself fortunate to have abandoned the habit before leaving home for college. The reason I succeeded in raising my children to be nonsmokers and my parents did not is that today’s environment is very different from the earlier one. By far the most powerful predictor of whether a person will smoke is the percentage of her closest friends who smoke. If the share of smokers in someone’s peer group rises to 30 percent from 20 percent, for example, the probability that she will smoke rises by about 25 percent . Whereas most of my teenage friends were smokers, relatively few of my sons’ friends were. In 2016 , only about 19 percent of American men were smokers, and only about 14 percent of women. Today’s environment is different mostly because of the taxes and other regulatory measures we have taken to discourage smoking. Well and good, but does anyone think that still having more than one smoker in six people is a desirable population ratio? Our stated rationale for discouraging smoking — to prevent harm caused by secondhand smoke — greatly understates the amount of harm that these actions prevent. When a regulation results in one smoker fewer, every friend of that person will have one smoker fewer in her peer group. Every member of every one of those peer groups will then become less likely to smoke. And that, in turn, will make others less likely to smoke, and so on. Most people don’t like being regulated, but even strict libertarians concede the legitimacy of regulations to prevent undue harm to others. As John Stuart Mill memorably wrote in “On Liberty”: “The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant.” Causing someone to be more likely to smoke clearly inflicts substantial harm on that person. I have never heard even the staunchest libertarian say, “I hope my children grow up to be smokers.” Further discouraging smoking now will make it much easier to raise children to be nonsmokers. Evidence suggests that stricter measures to discourage smoking would make even smokers themselves happier. In a 2005 study , for example, the economists Jonathan Gruber and Sendhil Mullainathan found that people with a higher propensity to smoke were significantly happier in places with higher cigarette taxes. Higher taxes, they noted, made it easier for smokers to quit. Today’s regulations to discourage smoking are strict, yes. But without violating libertarian sensibilities, we could adopt even stricter measures. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

And she was absolutely right, to a certain extent. But the awards shows were not all that the gowns and the colors and the faces and the glamour of the women on the red carpet were selling. They were also selling their own images, manufactured in collusion with the brands they represented, as well as the millions of magazines and websites (including, yes, our own) that recorded those images, and they were profiting — often handsomely — from it. To ignore that history and their own role in creating it is both hypocritical and ultimately undermines the perhaps meaningful shift in that equation, which may be taking place this weekend as the women involved finally use their clothes to do more than just boost a variety of bank accounts. Which is, let’s be honest, part of what they have been doing for more than two decades. To understand why this change is a big deal, you need to understand the background against which it is playing out. It’s hard to pinpoint when the red carpet became an economy unto itself — somewhere back in the late 20th century — but it has been a carefully cultivated marketing tool for generations now, built on an illusion into which we all buy: the largely fabricated pretense that actresses (and actors) are choosing their own gowns, and that what we see is a pure expression of their personal style. Fact is, what we are seeing is often a look that has been bought, and created, by a global brand, or group of brands, from clothes to shoes, bags, jewels, watches and hairstyles. And the individuals involved have been more than willing to secure their financial future by selling it: swirling in it, name-checking it and otherwise promoting it. For any major awards show (and the Globes certainly qualifies) many boldface nominees will have contractual relationships with fashion brands — negotiated by managers and agents — that require them to wear a gown or a tuxedo by that brand to that event. They may have input into the final product. They may even, with the help of a stylist (who is also often paid by both actor and brand) have chosen it themselves. But the idea that they chose it from all the gowns on option? The idea they — gasp! — shopped for it? Utter hooey. They chose it under very specific guidelines from a very specific selection. It began, as most sell-your-soul initiatives do, innocently enough. As the advent of the fashion police and the worst-dressed lists began to shine a light on the occasionally terrible taste of Hollywood (remember the Demi Moore bicycle shorts ball gown ?), designers seemed to provide a safe harbor of expert advice. Giorgio Armani was, famously, the first to realize the potential benefits, and became the founding father of the fashion/Hollywood axis. Soon, however, most of his peers followed. It was, largely, a mutually beneficial relationship of like-minded individuals where everyone benefited: A celebrity got a great dress, and a brand got a great-looking famous person in their dress, and we all got to ogle them. As movie receipts fell, however, fashion exploded, and money entered the picture. Soon talent (and their managers) realized that income lost in choosing, say, a small indie film to bolster acting cred, could be offset by agreeing to become an “ambassador” for a runway brand, a job that could range from a single appearance to ad campaigns, show and party attendance, and sometimes even product collaborations. Sometimes the payments went straight to a charity. Sometimes they went to support artistic choices. And thus the slippery slope was oiled by the best intentions, and down everyone slid. It’s a measure of how uncomfortable they all are with it that not a single part of the ecosystem is willing to admit on the record how much money changes hands. They barely want to discuss it at all. In 2015, at the Vulture festival , the stylist Jessica Paster went so far as to reveal that she got “anywhere between $30,000 to $50,000,” while actresses could receive “something between $100,000 and $250,000,” but she didn’t name names. The year before, Page Six announced Jennifer Lawrence was reportedly going to receive $15-20 million for her current three-year contract to represent Dior — a brand with one of the largest celeb stables in fashion (it includes Rihanna and Natalie Portman) — though the brand itself wasn’t talking. Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Miu Miu are also among the most starry-eyed of the runway names. Make no mistake: This is not changing, necessarily, because of the actresses’ decision to wear black. The same brands that would have dressed a celebrity in, say, a gold-tinged princess gown or a sequined aqua mermaid style will still dress them this year, albeit in a different shade. But it could change for a related reason. That is, whether the women and men in black will name-check the brands behind the clothes during their entrance interviews as they have in the past, and whether those brands will then send out the usual news releases claiming their celebrities and milking their investments. Because if those things don’t happen — and there’s a good chance they won’t, if the individuals and the companies that support them are really committed to their political messaging — then it could substantially alter the calculus. Selling anything more than an idea might not be a significant part of it at all. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

The story appeared, astonishingly, in The New England Journal of Medicine in the summer of 2007. Adopted as a kitten by the medical staff, Oscar reigned over one floor of the Steere House nursing home in Rhode Island. When the cat would sniff the air, crane his neck and curl up next to a man or woman, it was a sure sign of impending demise. The doctors would call the families to come in for their last visit. Over the course of several years, the cat had curled up next to 50 patients. Every one of them died shortly thereafter. No one knows how the cat acquired his formidable death-sniffing skills. Perhaps Oscar’s nose learned to detect some unique whiff of death — chemicals released by dying cells, say. Perhaps there were other inscrutable signs. I didn’t quite believe it at first, but Oscar’s acumen was corroborated by other physicians who witnessed the prophetic cat in action. As the author of the article wrote: “No one dies on the third floor unless Oscar pays a visit and stays awhile.” The story carried a particular resonance for me that summer, for I had been treating S., a 32-year-old plumber with esophageal cancer. He had responded well to chemotherapy and radiation, and we had surgically resected his esophagus, leaving no detectable trace of malignancy in his body. One afternoon, a few weeks after his treatment had been completed, I cautiously broached the topic of end-of-life care. We were going for a cure, of course, I told S., but there was always the small possibility of a relapse. He had a young wife and two children, and a mother who had brought him weekly to the chemo suite. Perhaps, I suggested, he might have a frank conversation with his family about his goals? But S. demurred. He was regaining strength week by week. The conversation was bound to be “a bummah,” as he put it in his distinct Boston accent. His spirits were up. The cancer was out. Why rain on his celebration? I agreed reluctantly; it was unlikely that the cancer would return. When the relapse appeared, it was a full-on deluge. Two months after he left the hospital, S. returned to see me with sprays of metastasis in his liver, his lungs and, unusually, in his bones. The pain from these lesions was so terrifying that only the highest doses of painkilling drugs would treat it, and S. spent the last weeks of his life in a state bordering on coma, unable to register the presence of his family around his bed. His mother pleaded with me at first to give him more chemo, then accused me of misleading the family about S.’s prognosis. I held my tongue in shame: Doctors, I knew, have an abysmal track record of predicting which of our patients are going to die. Death is our ultimate black box. In a survey led by researchers at University College London of over 12,000 prognoses of the life span of terminally ill patients, the hits and misses were wide-ranging. Some doctors predicted deaths accurately. Others underestimated death by nearly three months; yet others overestimated it by an equal magnitude. Even within oncology, there were subcultures of the worst offenders: In one story, likely apocryphal, a leukemia doctor was found instilling chemotherapy into the veins of a man whose I.C.U. monitor said that his heart had long since stopped. But what if an algorithm could predict death? In late 2016 a graduate student named Anand Avati at Stanford’s computer-science department, along with a small team from the medical school, tried to “teach” an algorithm to identify patients who were very likely to die within a defined time window. “The palliative-care team at the hospital had a challenge,” Avati told me. “How could we find patients who are within three to 12 months of dying?” This window was “the sweet spot of palliative care.” A lead time longer than 12 months can strain limited resources unnecessarily, providing too much, too soon; in contrast, if death came less than three months after the prediction, there would be no real preparatory time for dying — too little, too late. Identifying patients in the narrow, optimal time period, Avati knew, would allow doctors to use medical interventions more appropriately and more humanely. And if the algorithm worked, palliative-care teams would be relieved from having to manually scour charts, hunting for those most likely to benefit. Avati and his team identified about 200,000 patients who could be studied. The patients had all sorts of illnesses — cancer, neurological diseases, heart and kidney failure. The team’s key insight was to use the hospital’s medical records as a proxy time machine. Say a man died in January 2017. What if you scrolled time back to the “sweet spot of palliative care” — the window between January and October 2016 when care would have been most effective? But to find that spot for a given patient, Avati knew, you’d presumably need to collect and analyze medical information before that window. Could you gather information about this man during this prewindow period that would enable a doctor to predict a demise in that three-to-12-month section of time? And what kinds of inputs might teach such an algorithm to make predictions? Avati drew on medical information that had already been coded by doctors in the hospital: a patient’s diagnosis, the number of scans ordered, the number of days spent in the hospital, the kinds of procedures done, the medical prescriptions written. The information was admittedly limited — no questionnaires, no conversations, no sniffing of chemicals — but it was objective, and standardized across patients. These inputs were fed into a so-called deep neural network — a kind of software architecture thus named because it’s thought to loosely mimic the way the brain’s neurons are organized. The task of the algorithm was to adjust the weights and strengths of each piece of information in order to generate a probability score that a given patient would die within three to 12 months. The “dying algorithm,” as we might call it, digested and absorbed information from nearly 160,000 patients to train itself. Once it had ingested all the data, Avati’s team tested it on the remaining 40,000 patients. The algorithm performed surprisingly well. The false-alarm rate was low: Nine out of 10 patients predicted to die within three to 12 months did die within that window. And 95 percent of patients assigned low probabilities by the program survived longer than 12 months. (The data used by this algorithm can be vastly refined in the future. Lab values, scan results, a doctor’s note or a patient’s own assessment can be added to the mix, enhancing the predictive power.) So what, exactly, did the algorithm “learn” about the process of dying? And what, in turn, can it teach oncologists? Here is the strange rub of such a deep learning system: It learns, but it cannot tell us why it has learned; it assigns probabilities, but it cannot easily express the reasoning behind the assignment. Like a child who learns to ride a bicycle by trial and error and, asked to articulate the rules that enable bicycle riding, simply shrugs her shoulders and sails away, the algorithm looks vacantly at us when we ask, “Why?” It is, like death, another black box. Still, when you pry the box open to look at individual cases, you see expected and unexpected patterns. One man assigned a score of 0.946 died within a few months, as predicted. He had had bladder and prostate cancer, had undergone 21 scans, had been hospitalized for 60 days — all of which had been picked up by the algorithm as signs of impending death. But a surprising amount of weight was seemingly put on the fact that scans were made of his spine and that a catheter had been used in his spinal cord — features that I and my colleagues might not have recognized as predictors of dying (an M.R.I. of the spinal cord, I later realized, was most likely signaling cancer in the nervous system — a deadly site for metastasis). It’s hard for me to read about the “dying algorithm” without thinking about my patient S. If a more sophisticated version of such an algorithm had been available, would I have used it in his case? Absolutely. Might that have enabled the end-of-life conversation S. never had with his family? Yes. But I cannot shake some inherent discomfort with the thought that an algorithm might understand patterns of mortality better than most humans. And why, I kept asking myself, would such a program seem so much more acceptable if it had come wrapped in a black-and-white fur box that, rather than emitting probabilistic outputs, curled up next to us with retracted claws?

The problem, it seems, is that, in their current form, the cups are surprisingly hard to recycle, and therefore contribute an excessive amount to waste streams. On Friday, a parliamentary committee in Britain issued a report recommending a hefty tax of 25 pence, or 34 cents, for every cup sold. Dubbed the “latte levy,” the fee would amount to around 10 percent on every cup of coffee sold, presumably a painful enough charge to induce most people to carry around their own reusable cups. Disposable cups are often laminated with plastic or polyethylene to make them waterproof. But traditional paper mills and recycling facilities are not equipped for the complex process of stripping the plastic away. Instead, the containers end up in landfills or are burned in incinerators, a concern for environmentalists who say that toxins can seep into the ground or escape into the air. In Britain alone, 2.5 billion cups are discarded each year, enough to circle the planet five and a half times, according to the parliamentary report. That number could expand to five billion cups a year in seven years’ time as the explosive growth of cafe culture in the country shows few signs of abating. The proposal for a coffee tax follows a 5-pence charge for plastic bags at stores, introduced in Britain in 2015, which has led to a plunge in usage of more than 80 percent. Some consumers complained that the latest levy should be imposed on coffee retailers, rather than coffee drinkers. But supporters of the campaign say that a tax may well force a shift in consumer behavior, as it did with plastic bags. “The polluter should pay for it,” Simon Ellin, chief executive of t he Recycling Association , said in an interview. “It shouldn’t be the public that should pay for it, but we’d still be in favor because it will change behavior.” But Ian Fisher, 49, who was taking his breakfast at Costa, a major coffee chain, found the tax proposal “unacceptable,” adding, “Coffee is expensive enough, and it’s not going to cure the problem of people littering.” Most coffee chains currently offer small discounts when drinks are served in reusable cups. Starbucks on Friday said it was looking to test a 5-pence paper cup charge in 25 stores across London starting in February. “We will investigate the impact of a 5 pence charge on a paper cup, coupled with prominent marketing of reusable cups,” the coffee giant said. Caffe Nero , another prominent coffee retailer, said it was committed to increasing “the sustainable recovery and recycling of paper cups.” Costa , the biggest coffee chain in Britain, said it had collected more than 12 million cups for recycling over the past year, though it was not clear how many of those were recycled. Members of Parliament behind the report dismissed the efforts made by coffee shops and cup manufacturers. They have “recently made voluntary commitments or provide in-store recycling, some of which were introduced during the course of the inquiry,” the report said. “However, despite having spent years talking about the problem, industry’s voluntary commitments have been inconsistent and ineffective.” A 2011 consumer survey cited by the lawmakers found that eight in 10 consumers were laboring under the misconception that disposable cups were being recycled, and that most consumers tried to discard their cups in recycling bins. The report found that fewer than one cup in 400, or 0.25 percent, gets recycled. There are alternatives to the latte levy. Two facilities in Britain have the capacity to recycle disposable cups, having invested in the multimillion-dollar machinery needed to strip the plastic away from the paper. “The tricky part is taking the plastic from the fiber,” said Richard Burnett, market development manager at James Cropper , a fine-paper manufacturer that recycles the paper into upscale shopping bags for department stores like Selfridges. The operation has the capability to recycle half a billion paper cups a year, he said by telephone, but they were not being collected properly and sent to the manufacturer, based some 260 miles north of London, to be recycled. “That’s the missing part of the jigsaw puzzle,” he said. Since paper cups only make up less than 1 percent of total packaging waste in Britain, most paper mills have not invested in specialized machinery, Mr. Burnett said. Paper recyclers also generally reject packaging that has been “contaminated,” or come into contact with food or drink. On the other end of the spectrum, some companies are starting to develop cups that can be recycled more easily. Frugalpac’s “Frugal Cup” contains a plastic liner that is glued only lightly so that it separates quickly and easily when the cup is re-pulped, lawmakers said.

Another would treat blood cancer. A third would use the body’s immune system to kill tumors. All three show encouraging results, and need just one more step to be approved for use in the United States. The drugs have something else in common: They were created in China. For years, China’s drug industry concentrated on replicating Western medicines. Getting new drugs approved was a frustrating and time-consuming process. Companies thought plowing millions of dollars into research and development was risky and stuck to safer revenue streams. The country is now pushing to play a bigger role in the global drug industry. Millions of people in China have cancer or diabetes, and the government has made pharmaceutical innovation a national priority. Officials have promised to speed up drug approvals, and to reverse a brain drain by luring scientists back home. The authorities are providing land, grants and tax breaks, and investing in research. The three new drugs will have to clear American regulatory hurdles. If they do, they can stand as proof of China’s growing ability to produce cutting-edge treatments, part of a broader transformation of the country’s economy as it moves into higher-value and increasingly complex sectors. China’s drug development is in the earliest stages compared to the broader industry. Some experts say, however, that it is only a matter of time before China’s medical companies stand alongside Big Pharma giants like Pfizer and AstraZeneca. “It’s not whether they are going to,” said Jonathan Wang, senior managing director of OrbiMed Asia, a health care investment fund. “They are going to.” For now, access to quality drugs remains a problem in China. Many people buy medicines from Hong Kong and Macau — territories governed by separate laws. Online forums are devoted to discussing smuggling generics from India. Others buy the raw ingredients to make the drugs at home. Those who can afford it fly to the United States . A growing number of companies are trying to address that shortfall. Hutchison China MediTech, a firm backed by Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing, started out in 2000 trying to develop the herbal drugs used in traditional Chinese medicine. In 2005, the company, known as Chi-Med, started developing cancer drugs. At its main laboratory in Shanghai, upward of 350 scientists are surrounded by rodents in testing rooms. More than half the scientists are at work trying to discover new drugs. In October, Chi-Med reported that more than 60 percent of patients in second-stage clinical trials had responded positively to its drug, savolitinib, which it is developing together with AstraZeneca. Savolitinib — the first drug of its kind — can be used to treat lung, kidney, gastric and colorectal cancers; it is often used in combination with other AstraZeneca drugs to shut down pathways that allow the cancer to spread. Chi-Med is awaiting more data. But if further tests get positive results, the company will apply for what is known as breakthrough therapy designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration. It still needs to run Phase 3 trials, the last step before seeking full approval from the F.D.A., but breakthrough therapy status would allow the final stage to be sped up. The trials involve drugs being tested, often against placebos, for their safety and effectiveness on as many as several thousand patients. Laura Nelson Carney, an Asia-Pacific health care analyst at Bernstein Research, said that based on the industry average, the probability of success in Phase 3 trials is 60 to 70 percent. If all goes according to plan, regulatory approval could come in late 2019, at the earliest, said Christian Hogg, Chi-Med’s chief executive. “It takes 20 years to get an overnight success, and that’s where we are at the moment,” he said. The last time China produced a new drug for the global pharmaceutical industry was in the 1970s, when the Chinese scientist Tu Youyou was credited with the discovery of artemisinin after Mao Zedong asked her to come up with a cure for malaria . But global recognition did not come until much later, after the Swiss drug maker Novartis bought the Chinese patent and started producing it in the late 1990s. Ms. Tu was eventually awarded a Nobel Prize in 2015 . That is changing. Along with Chi-Med, another company, BeiGene, is already in Phase 3 trials globally for a drug used to treat a variety of lymphomas, the most common form of blood cancer, and an immunotherapy drug that aims to destroy tumors. It has also teamed up with Celgene and Merck to develop cancer drugs. Ms. Carney said she expected 20 or 30 Chinese-made drugs to seek Phase 3 trials in the United States, the world’s biggest market for cancer drugs, within the next five years. Those that make it through will very likely be cheaper than those made by foreign companies, she said, based on current pricing patterns in China. Meanwhile, Big Pharma is shrugging off its long-held fears of China’s rampant counterfeiting and cumbersome bureaucracy and setting up its own labs here. Johnson &amp; Johnson, Novartis and Sanofi have all opened research centers in Shanghai to create drugs for Chinese patients. Executives say that the government has made inroads in toughening protections of pharmaceutical patents. And the pace of approvals has also quickened. In worst-case scenarios, drug companies needed to wait up to two years to get permission just to start clinical trials, which would then take several more years. The comparable waiting period in the United States is typically 30 days. Under Bi Jingquan, who was appointed the head of China’s Food and Drug Administration in 2015, the agency has begun cracking down on companies making low-quality drugs and agreed to accept foreign data for clinical trials. Now, thanks to those shifts, as well as incentives offered by the government, scientists trained overseas are returning to China. After 20 years in the United States with Eli Lilly and Pfizer, Joan Shen moved to Shanghai in 2011 to lead clinical trials for Pfizer. She now heads research and development for a Chinese biotech firm, I-Mab Biopharma. The local government has helped secure funding for the company, and provided laboratory space in a high-tech business park. “The funds are chasing us,” she said, comparing the investment environment between China and the United States, “instead of us having to spend numerous hours convincing investors.” Despite the optimism, Chinese pharmaceutical companies that want to go abroad still face obstacles. Competition among drugmakers in major markets like the United States is intense, and Chinese companies are hamstrung in particular by a lack of money committed to research. Jiangsu Hengrui, a Chinese company that has been moving toward developing new drugs from making generic ones, has the largest research budget of all Chinese drug firms. But its $180 million annual outlay pales in comparison with the $7.8 billion that Pfizer spent in 2016. Still, with several drugs in early-stage testing, it is targeting what Zhang Lianshan, the company’s head of research and development, described as its “ultimate goal”: regulatory approval in the United States. “If you have a drug approved by the U.S. F.D.A.,” Mr. Zhang said, “that’s a true demonstration of innovation.” ', 0, 0, 5, 1);

Why Are You Taking a Statin?', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/health/statin-over-75.html?partner=rss&emc=rss', '2018-01-06 18:52:16', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/09/science/09SPAN/09SPAN-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'Should a 76-year-old who doesn’t have heart disease, but does have certain risk factors for developing it, take a statin to ward off heart attacks or strokes? You’d think we’d have a solid answer to this question. These widely prescribed medications lower cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular disease, the nation’s most common killer, and get much of the credit for the nation’s plummeting rates of heart attacks and strokes . When they entered common use in the 1990s, “it was very exciting,” said Dr. Ariela Orkaby, a geriatrician at the Harvard Medical School and lead author of a new study on statins in older adults. “Suddenly you had a drug that could reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke by 20 or 30 percent or more.” So current medical guidelines recommend statins for people in that no-heart-disease category, a strategy called primary prevention — but only for those up to age 75. Yet a lmost half of adults aged 75 and older take statins , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported. Some of those people probably are taking drugs that aren’t helping and can cause problems, researchers and geriatricians say. On the other hand, some older patients who likely would benefit from statins aren’t taking them. “This is a situation that makes most doctors very uncomfortable,” said Dr. Sei Lee, a geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco. “Some feel these drugs have been successful used in younger patients, so why not use them?” So why not? “We don’t have good specific data for people without known heart disease over age 75,” Dr. Lee said. “Are statins helpful or harmful for them? The honest answer is, we don’t know.” To be clear: Statins make sense for adults of any age who already have heart disease, who have suffered a heart attack or stroke, or who have had arteries unblocked with a procedure like stenting. This is called secondary prevention. In 2013, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued a series of statin recommendations for primary prevention, relevant to adults up to age 75 who have high cholesterol or diabetes, or who for other reasons face an estimated 7.5 percent risk or greater of developing heart disease within 10 years. Last year, the United States Preventive Services Task Force similarly recommended statins for primary prevention in people aged 40 to 75 who had risk factors like high cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure or smoking, with a 10-year disease risk of 10 percent or greater. But for people over age 75, both panels agreed, there was not sufficient evidence to reach a conclusion. As with many clinical trials, the major statin studies mostly haven’t included patients at advanced ages. “The oldest patients enrolled have been up to age 82,” said Dr. Michael Rich, a geriatric cardiologist at Washington University School of Medicine, referring to the PROSPER study published in 2002 . The authors of that study followed 5,800 patients for three years and found that pravastatin provided secondary, but not primary, prevention against cardiovascular events. But Dr. Paul Ridker, a self-described “statin advocate” who directs the Center for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, gets irked at the argument that we don’t know enough to give statins to older patients without heart disease. “I don’t believe there’s any doubt that statin therapy is effective for primary prevention in older adults,” Dr. Ridker said. He cites a recent reanalysis of data from two major studies showing that patients over age 70 taking statins experienced the same reductions in cardiovascular events and mortality as younger ones. Dr. Orkaby and her Harvard colleagues hoped to help resolve such questions with their recent study, published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, comparing physicians over age 70 who took statins for primary prevention with those who didn’t. The team matched each group for 30 variables and found that over an average of seven years, statin-takers had an 18 percent lower death rate , though not a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular events. In the same issue, though, an editorial co-authored by Dr. Rich called statin use for primary prevention in older patients “an unresolved conundrum.” The physician study was observational, so can’t establish causes, he pointed out. And it followed a group that was healthier than average, and all male. Moreover, he said, the findings suggest the drugs had more benefit for those under age 77. What’s not debatable is that while statins do effectively lower cholesterol in older people, their advantages and disadvantages add up differently than at younger ages. A fairly common side effect, for instance, is myalgia, muscle aches sometimes combined with fatigue. Dr. Orkaby estimates that up to 30 percent of statin takers experience this symptom. Sandy Koo, 72, a retired teacher in Los Altos, Calif., began taking Lipitor in her 50s. It lowered her cholesterol, but she found that “I’d walk a block and a half, and I was so achy I had to sit down.” She cycled through other statins for years, looking for one that didn’t make her legs hurt. Myalgia reverses when people stop taking statins (which also have more serious, but very rare, side effects). Still, many older people already struggle to remain mobile and perform daily tasks. At advanced ages, “it’s easier to lose your functional ability and harder to get it back,” said Dr. Lee. (A few small studies report a reversible cognitive impact from statins, too, but he and other researchers didn’t give much credence to the finding.) Further, older people often take multiple drugs. Statins interact with scores of them, including proton pump inhibitors (like Nexium), blood pressure and heart medications (like Plavix), and many antibiotics. Complicating the debate, the 2013 guidelines called for “high-intensity” statin therapy — high doses of atorvastatin (Lipitor) or rosuvastatin (Crestor) — for primary prevention up to age 75, for those who can tolerate it. “Many patients were doing fine for years on a low-intensity statin, and it was doing the job, reducing their cholesterol,” Dr. Orkaby said. When switched to high-intensity regimens, “they developed the symptoms you might expect, so they stopped taking them at all.” All of which argues for a thoughtful conversation for patients in their late 70s and beyond whose physicians suggest starting — or stopping — a statin. It can take two to five years for a statin to pay off preventively , so a healthy 80-year-old expected to live that long might well opt to take one or to continue taking one. “It’s a well known, proven therapy that might prevent a devastating illness,” Dr. Orkaby said. By trying different statins at different dosages, she said, patients usually can find a comfortable regimen. On the other hand, she routinely stops statins for nursing home residents — who are already very ill — or for elders who are frail, have life-limiting diseases, or grapple with an already daunting number of prescriptions. “There are a lot of unknowns,” Dr. Orkaby said. “We don’t want to do harm by prescribing a medication. And we don’t want to do harm by withholding it.” ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

Don’t I get depressed, she wants to know, talking to all those old people? The short answer is no. The slightly longer answer is that no work I have ever done has brought me as much joy and hope, or changed my outlook on life as profoundly. Even now, I am surprised to be writing those words. In early 2015, I began a series of articles following six New Yorkers age 85 and older — one of the fastest-growing age groups in the country. The six lived in nursing homes or walk-up apartments; they played mah-jongg or listened to opera or made scratchy independent movies. One found new love in old age; one said at every interview that he wanted to die. All six had beaten the odds just by living that long. At the beginning of 2018, having just revisited them in “ Want to Be Happy? Think Like an Old Person ,” I can say that four are still beating them. The series explored what old age looked like to the people who were living it. What it did not explore is what effect these elders were having on the middle-aged reporter who was spending more and more time with them. The people in the series became more than story subjects . They shared intimate thoughts about life and, quite often, death. I went to a jazz club to see Jonas Mekas; a podiatrist appointment with Fred Jones; a dim sum restaurant in Chinatown with Ping Wong; a New Jersey beach house with Ruth Willig. I told them about my mother, who turned 89 last month, and about my impending divorce. They gave me chocolates and writings and showed me photographs of themselves in their youth. They had complaints, sometimes quite a lot of them. But as often as not they shared thoughts about things that brought them joy. One day in his apartment, Fred Jones asked me my definition of happiness, then gave me his own. “Happiness to me is what’s happening now,” he said. The apartment, a cluttered wreck that was up two flights of stairs he could barely climb, was an unlikely place to look for happiness, and Mr. Jones, whose health was failing, was an unlikely spokesman. But he never dwelt on his problems. “If you’re not happy at the present time, then you’re not happy,” he said. “Some people say, if I get that new fur coat for the winter, or get myself a new automobile, I’ll be happy then. But you don’t know what’s going to happen by that time. Right now, are you happy?” Whenever I asked him the happiest time of his life, he said without hesitation, “Right now.” The six became models for the challenges in my own life, living examples of resilience, gratitude and the wisdom that comes from living through ups and downs in history. Even amid the very real hardships of old age, all found reasons or opportunities to be happy. In early 2016, I wrote the words “Happiness Is a Choice You Make” on a sheet of paper and taped it to the wall by my nightstand. It was Mr. Jones’s wisdom filtered through that of all the others. Right now, are you happy? They were words to live by, at any age. Why not? In the rest of the year I wrote a book by that title, due out this month, with a subtitle giving credit where it is due: “Lessons from a year among the oldest old.” This time, I tell the story that is not in the Times series. In some ways, the title is an answer to my mother’s question, and an homage to six people and one assignment that changed my life. The effects carried me through this year, as the daily maelstrom of current events roiled friends around me. No, I did not get depressed spending time with old people. I became more patient, less anxious, more capable of loving, less afraid of death and decline. Which is to say, more like an old person. And grateful for it. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

Overwhelmed in Britain, Leaving Patients to Wait', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/world/europe/uk-national-health-service.html?partner=rss&emc=rss', '2018-01-04 04:13:10', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/04/world/europe/04nhs1/04nhs1-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'LONDON — At some emergency wards, patients wait more than 12 hours before they are tended to. Corridors are jammed with beds carrying frail and elderly patients waiting to be admitted to hospital wards. Outpatient appointments were canceled to free up staff members, and by Wednesday morning hospitals had been ordered to postpone nonurgent surgeries until the end of the month. Cuts to the National Health Service budget in Britain have left hospitals stretched over the winter for years, but this time a flu outbreak, colder weather and high levels of respiratory illnesses have put the N.H.S. under the highest strain in decades. The situation has become so dire that the head of the health service is warning that the system is overwhelmed. Some doctors took to Twitter to vent their frustrations publicly. One complained of having to practice “battlefield medicine,” while another apologized for the “3rd world conditions” caused by overcrowding. In November, the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, announced an additional 350 million pounds, or $475 million, for the National Health Service in England, describing it as an “exceptional measure” to ease pressures on services during the winter. He said an additional £1.6 billion would be provided for 2018-19. But that fell far short of the £4 billion in additional funding that Simon Stevens, the chief executive of the service in England, requested last year, warning that services would come under unprecedented pressure during the winter. “The N.H.S. waiting list will grow to five million people by 2021,” Mr. Stevens said in an impassioned speech to health care leaders in November. “That is one million more people, equivalent to one in 10 of us, the highest number ever.” What’s more, he said, “after seven years of understandable but unprecedented constraint on the current budget, the N.H.S. can no longer do everything that is being asked of it.” Over the past week, hospitals have increasingly declared “black alerts,” an admission that they are unable to cope with demand, the health service confirmed, without releasing numbers. Most hospitals have been unable to meet emergency-ward targets of seeing patients within four hours because of a shortage of beds and staff. Prime Minister Theresa May denied that the National Health Service was facing a crisis. “The N.H.S. has been better prepared for this winter than ever before, we have put extra funding in,” she said on Wednesday. “There are more beds available across the system. We’ve reduced the number of delayed discharges of elderly people who would otherwise have been in N.H.S. beds rather than in social care,” she added, referring to state-funded care. But the scenes unfolding across hospitals in Britain paint a different picture. Tuesday night, the emergency ward at Kingston Hospital in southwestern London looked more like an airport lounge than a hospital, with patients sprawled out in the waiting room. “There’s no real system or order; it’s a jungle in here,” said Nancy Harper, who had accompanied her 87-year-old grandmother, who was lying down and complaining of excruciating pain in her lower back. “It’s been more than five hours,” Ms. Harper said. “We get to the front of the queue and then someone more ill comes in and we get pushed back. It’s outrageous.” Other patients said they had been turned away and referred to a pharmacy or general practitioner because their cases were not deemed urgent enough. “I don’t even think I was seen by a nurse,” said Ali Elamine, who complained of acute ear pain. “Some helper just took my temperature, said it was normal and told me to go to my local G.P. in the morning.” Many hospitals have asked that patients seek help from emergency rooms only for urgent or life-threatening matters. More than nine million people at emergency wards in the 2016-17 fiscal year were sent home after receiving only guidance that in many cases could have been obtained from a pharmacist, the health service said in a statement on Tuesday. And Jane Cummings, the chief nursing officer for N.H.S. England, said that millions of patients had missed hospital appointments last year, at a cost of almost £1 billion. “With the N.H.S. coming under pressure as never before, we are asking patients and the public to use the health service responsibly,” she said, “to help ensure that care is readily available for everyone who needs it.” Dr. Anu Mitra, an emergency physician at Imperial College Healthcare N.H.S. Trust, said that 70 years ago, as the country was recovering from the devastation of war, the health service had been the country’s “greatest gift.” But “awful days like today” are a result of a systematic dismantling of the system eight years in the making. “Two years ago I’d have point blank refused to examine a corridor patient until they were in a cubicle,” Dr. Mitra said on Twitter early Wednesday. “On days like this it’s unavoidable, I’m ashamed to say.” The extraordinarily high pressure has led to resignations. In December, Bob Kerslake, the chairman of the board at King’s College hospital in London, quit in protest over what he viewed as the government’s insufficient funding of health services. “We desperately need a fundamental rethink,” he wrote in an opinion piece in The Guardian. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologized to patients on Wednesday for the postponement of thousands of nonurgent operations. “It is absolutely not what I want,” he told Sky News . “There are real pressures, no doubt about it. This is the busiest week of the year for the N.H.S.” Patients have accused hospitals of putting them at risk. “I learned about the new set of deferrals from the news, but if I receive a notification, it will be the third time my operation is postponed,” Graham Groves, a construction worker, said as he sat in a cafe at St. Mary’s Hospital on Wednesday. “This is a disgrace. We injure ourselves while working to pay our taxes, and the government just leaves us to suffer.” ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

Just days earlier, she, her extended family and others on a group tour were scheduled to fly the same airline. But Nature Air made a last-minute change and “instead of three, two-engine planes the group would be put on four, single-engine Cessna planes,” Ms. Block Weissman said. Concerned about the unexpected switch, their tour guide canceled their plans to fly and had them travel by bus and boat instead. Ms. Block Weissman said that she was “disappointed not to see the rain forest from the air,” but when she learned about the tragedy days later, she wondered if there was anything she could do to judge the safety of a foreign air charter. “We want the people in the back seat to know there is a resource to get information,” said Art Dawley, the chief executive of Wyvern , which assesses air charter services for corporate flight departments, frequent users of private aviation and more recently, ordinary travelers who do not usually take charters like Ms. Block Weissman. For $49, Wyvern provides a report that includes the charter company’s insurance information, maintenance and pilot reports and an audit of the company’s safety systems (if available) so travelers can know “the airline has done everything it can to be sure is has managed risk to the industry standard,” Mr. Dawley said. Cincinnati-based Arg/us, which also audits the safety practices of participating air charter companies, gives travelers access to similar information through an online query called TripCheq . The fee is $150. But many people are booked on charters through cruise lines or tour operators and they may take the safety of the airline for granted, said Brian Alexander, an aviation attorney. “People believe air operators are totally checked out and connected to and insured by the cruise ships or tour people,” he said, but that is not always the case. Mr. Alexander said that travelers on charters they have not booked themselves should always ask the cruise line, “What have you done to assure yourself this is a safe and experienced operation?” Air travel has never been safer than it was in the year just past with just two fatal accidents among commercial airlines worldwide. Still, risk varies by region. The Middle East and North Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean and the Commonwealth of Independent States in Eurasia have the highest accident rates; between 2.8 and 5.8 accidents per million flights. That’s three to five times the rate in North Asia and North America, according to statistics compiled by the International Air Transport Association. Many factors contribute to the disparity including how pilots, mechanics, ground personnel and air traffic controllers are hired and trained, how airplanes are maintained and the state of the runways, radar, weather forecasting and communication systems. Governmental oversight is critical, safety specialists said. As a former air accident investigator and the author of two books on the subject, I am often told by people that they assume regulation is the same around the world, but that is not the case. “Oversight can be anywhere from pretty good in the U.S. and Europe while in many other places it’s a crapshoot,” Mr. Alexander said. Travelers need to keep safety in perspective. A government not controlling hazards in aviation is probably equally lax on other modes of public transport. Statistically speaking, long distance commercial aviation is safer than driving or any other form of transportation, according to the I.A.T.A. Here, some ideas for checking out air charter services. Inspect the facility Aviation requires attention to detail and an aversion to hazards. Consider it a warning if you arrive at the airport and the appearance of the company, the airplane or the flight crew doesn’t seem professional. Michele Markarian, the director of strategic accounts for the website Air Charter Guide and an experienced traveler, once walked away from a flight she had booked because the airplane didn’t look up to snuff. Allow extra time Travelers may be tempted to set aside their worries if rushing to the next destination. Having extra time to find an alternative will alleviate the pressure of getting on a plane you don’t feel comfortable about. Check references Call the company and ask for references. Trip Advisor also has an airline review page , and a Twitter search using a hashtag with the airline name can also be illuminating. Already there? Frank Craven of Air Charter Guide recommends asking locals for their opinion by saying, “‘I’m about to fly with ABC, what’s their reputation?’ They might tell you, ‘My drunk uncle is one of the pilots.’ So asking for information is good.” What does the United States government think? The Federal Aviation Administration’s online International Aviation Safety Assessment contains a list of countries that meet international aviation safety and oversight standards. The list is comprehensive but only includes countries whose airlines are permitted to fly to the United States. See the paperwork There are three documents that all charter airlines ought to be able to show you, according to Wyvern’s Mr. Dawley: its air operations certificate, its insurance certificate and the pilots’ qualifications — all should be available at the airline office. Network protection Any domestic or regional carrier, including those that offer charter flights that are associated with an airline alliance like Oneworld or Star Alliance, will have to pass a safety audit; if it has an intercarrier ticketing arrangement, the major carrier, is responsible for auditing their operations, according to John Darbo, a retired safety manager for a United States airline who is now a private safety consultant. Recently, I.A.T.A. started a review process for small planes. The few companies participating can be found online . Google it Aviation’s thriving online community makes it possible to find out nearly everything you want to know about airplanes. The Air Charter Guide offers information about planes, pilots, operators and a glossary of terms. Expect to pay Keeping up with regulations, the cost of fuel, training and keeping pilots and mechanics proficient means charter flights will be expensive. “You get what you pay for,” Ms. Markarian said. “A good charter with excellent service, top-notch and good crews is not cheap.” Christine Negroni is the author of “The Crash Detectives” (Penguin Books ).

This month MedStar , a 10-hospital nonprofit health care system, has begun testing the gown at one of its smaller community hospitals, the Montgomery Medical Center in Olney, Md. If the trial run is successful, MedStar will use the gown in its other locations. Given that in 2017, between inpatient admissions, observation stays and emergency-room visits, MedStar had about 678,000 patients who needed gowns, that’s a big potential audience for a new look. (The gown will also be available on the Care and Wear website , for $45, starting Jan. 3.) “The current patient gown, with the ties in the back, reinforces a power imbalance between patients and caregivers,” said Dr. Mark Smith, the chief innovation officer of MedStar Health and the director of the MedStar Institute for Innovation. “Patients get stripped of their sense of personhood, of their privacy.” Though fashion has occasionally flirted with designing for the health care market , previous initiatives have been limited and far between. Cynthia Rowley designed a series of hospital outfits for patients at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey in 1999, and Diane von Furstenberg helped dream up a gown in a special pattern for Cleveland Clinic in 2010. Annie and Isabel , Gownies and Dear Johnnies offer lines of simple, patterned hospital gowns for individuals to purchase, for $20 to $75. However, the hospital wear has never been a focus of fashion education before, or treated as a plausible career path. “It’s a large market that no one knows about,” said Chaitenya Razdan, a co-founder and the chief executive of Care and Wear. Nationally, about 140 million people visited emergency rooms in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control . According to Mr. Razdan, the number of gowns hospitals typically require is four to five times the number of patients who will use them. That’s a lot of gowns. “If we want to make meaningful change, it’s critical that we partner with companies where we actually put products into the world that have longevity and impact, and we get a sense of how we can measure our social impact,” said Brendan McCarthy, an assistant professor and the program director of the Systems and Materiality pathway at Parsons, whose students helped design the gown. The purpose of the pathway is to expose students to all of the interrelated parts of fashion design, including the sourcing of materials, labor, production practices, waste management and recycling. The light blue gown MedStar is testing features ties on both sides of the body, one inside and one outside; wide sleeves with plastic snaps that allow the upper arms to be easily exposed when, for example, an IV is needed; a front pocket with a slit for devices that monitor vital signs; side pockets for personal items; and a specially designed pleat in the back to address the aforementioned backside problem. It is made out of a cotton and polyester blend that Rachel Sax Ramos, the head of product at Care and Wear, described as a “hospital chambray” and that can stand up to multiple rounds of laundering. Irene Lu, a student from Parsons who worked on the gown, said that a challenge the entire class struggled with was how to make a gown that would give clinicians easy access but also allow for modesty. “With the original gown, there’s a reason the back is so open,” Ms. Lu said. The students’ solutions — the box pleat and the plastic snaps — impressed Dr. Smith. “With the snaps, you take it down and half of their chest is exposed,” Dr. Smith said. “You can examine the front of a patient without having to cover them up additionally. It gives you terrific access, and the patient feels safe and protected and comfortable.” The box pleat in back “operates like a giant skirt slit that you can open up to have full access, but if you’re walking around or waiting in the E.R., you’re not hanging out, which was everybody’s biggest pain point,” Ms. Sax Ramos said. The gown comes in small, medium, large and bariatric, denoted by swatches of fabric in different colors stitched into the collar. “It’s really up to my generation of designers to look forward and figure out how to change the system of fashion, and make it more sustainable,” Ms. Lu said. “I want to focus on creating innovative articles of clothing that really help people with real-life issues rather than constantly putting out collection after collection, season after season. Do we really want to put our resources, time and energy into cycles like that?” ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd: , our new email newsletter. WASHINGTON — If 2017 was the Trump administration’s year of grand pronouncements declaring an end to environmental regulations, 2018 will be the year of trying to finish what it started. Despite President Trump’s proclamation in the Rose Garden that the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement , the United States is still in the Paris agreement. Despite a trip by Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, to Kentucky coal country to announce an end to the Clean Power Plan rule curbing coal plant emissions, the Clean Power Plan still stands. And a host of other federal regulations, from controls on methane emissions to protections for wetlands, remain on the books despite executive orders declaring them void. The administration opened the new year by proposing to reverse a ban on offshore oil and gas drilling in most United States coastal waters. But environmentalists and proponents of deregulation alike say they expect fewer high-profile announcements over all and more action in the courts, where both sides will fight over the future of deregulation. “You may not see as many fireworks as there were in the past, but I think it’s going to be an even more significant year,” predicted Representative Rob Bishop, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee. Here are some things to look for in 2018: Mr. Pruitt put forward a formal plan in October to eliminate the Clean Power Plan, the Obama-era regulation restricting emissions from new coal-fired power plants. But analysts say the road to getting rid of the regulation is still a long one. The public has a chance to weigh in on the effort until Jan. 16. But the E.P.A. recently announced that new hearings would be held in San Francisco, Gillette, Wyo., and Kansas City, Mo. The dates have not been scheduled, but the meetings could push back the comment period and by extension progress on the full repeal. The agency has indicated it plans to devise a new, narrower version of the regulation. Yet so far, all it has done is ask the public for thoughts on what a new rule should look like. “They’re nowhere near the end of the line on the Clean Power Plan,” said David Doniger, director of the Climate and Clean Energy Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. If the E.P.A. kills the regulation before it moves forward with a replacement, Mr. Doniger said, the agency could be vulnerable to lawsuits because under the Clean Air Act it will still be obligated to address carbon dioxide. “They have a long way to go to finish their rollback goals,” Mr. Doniger said. “And when they finish, we will see them in court.” Scott H. Segal, a lawyer with the firm Bracewell who supports rolling back the Clean Power Plan, said replacing the rule — presumably with one that merely directs coal plants to enact efficiency measures — would allow utilities to plan ahead and would serve “as a bulwark against frivolous litigation.” Mr. Pruitt told coal industry executives in June that he wanted the E.P.A. to conduct a “red team-blue team” debate to raise questions about climate science. But there has been no public announcement about such an effort to date. That might not stop a broader inquiry into the legal underpinning of E.P.A. climate regulations, a 2009 document known as the endangerment finding. The endangerment finding concludes that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and must be regulated under the Clean Air Act. As long as it stands, the E.P.A. will be obligated to address climate change, even without the Clean Power Plan. Legal experts agree that challenging the endangerment finding will be an uphill battle. But it may be one Mr. Pruitt wants to wage. In several interviews last year Mr. Pruitt cast doubt on the document, and he has faced pressure from his supporters to overturn it. Yet he has avoided declaring definitively whether he will do so. Repealing the Clean Power Plan may force Mr. Pruitt to make a decision one way or another by the end of the year. With a major tax bill out of the way, Mr. Trump has said he hopes to tackle infrastructure next. That could create an opening for some of the year’s biggest environmental changes. Mr. Bishop said he hoped any infrastructure bill would incorporate changes to the Endangered Species Act, which many conservatives argue has been used to thwart development. He also wants to overhaul a 1969 law that requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions. “People have realized over and over again how that bill that was supposed to be passed so there is local input is being used to stop progress,” Mr. Bishop said of the law, the National Environmental Policy Act. He has previously introduced legislation that would make the endangered species law more friendly to landowners and industry. “If there is a big infrastructure bill we will try to put those all in a big package,” Mr. Bishop said. “If not we will try to move them in pieces.” Christy Goldfuss, who led the White House Council on Environmental Quality in the Obama administration, said she expected a bruising battle. “The infrastructure fight will be very much set up as a false choice between putting people to work and destroying the bedrock environmental laws,” she said. Efforts to weaken rules on the construction of roads and bridges, she said, do not draw attention like debates over climate change. But she asserted that undermining fundamental environmental safeguards will do long term damage. “This is going to be a big fight for the environmental community,” she said. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

Andy, a veteran climber and a friend of mine, had been living with Stage IV lung cancer for three years. “To live one year was statistically unlikely, and two years looked like a miracle,” he said. He was able to make the climb thanks to the success of a cutting-edge gene therapy clinical trial. It targeted his specific lung cancer mutation, shutting off the fuel to his tumor’s growth and shrinking the tumor. He wasn’t cured, but his scans were strikingly improved and he was almost symptom-free. The trip illustrates a shifting landscape both for oncologists and cancer patients exploring a return to active lifestyles. Dr. Tomas Neilan, the director of the cardio-oncology program at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and part of Andy’s medical team, said the recent success of these gene therapy treatments alters the way specialists like him view and treat advanced cancer patients. “They’re taking Stage IV cancer and turning it into a chronic disease no different than high blood pressure,” he said. Andy, 61, of Ipswich, Mass., had a window of good health, a honeymoon of indeterminate time during which he could resume the activities he loved. He played in his coffeehouse band, traveled and took long bike rides up the coast. He also accepted a friend’s invitation to climb in Nepal. Over three strenuous weeks he and his wife, Jan, who is a registered nurse and an experienced outdoorswoman, trekked alongside eight other climbers and several guides, most of whom they’d traveled with in the past. In announcing the trip on his Caring Bridge page to ask for donations to fund lung cancer research, Andy had said there was a slim chance he’d summit. At the altitude he reached, there’s 70 percent less air pressure than at sea level to push air into the lungs. Breathing is hard for the fittest climbers. There was no data on what the high altitude would do to an advanced lung cancer patient: None were found to have tried. “It’s a remarkable achievement,” Dr. Neilan said. “My colleagues are flabbergasted.” He gave Andy the O.K. to go to Nepal not as a dying man attempting his last climb but as a person with a deep experience in the mountains who exhibited solid cardiovascular function and health. In the previous months Andy had climbed high peaks in Maine and New Hampshire. Years earlier he’d traveled to Nepal for a trekking trip without incident. Dr. Neilan, a climber himself, said he found no data around altitude sickness — the most dangerous and common health risk for climbing in high mountains — and Andy’s conditions. But Dr. Neilan knew that at lower altitude even healthy younger climbers tended to have a greater likelihood of pulmonary edema and cerebral edema. They reviewed a series of warning signs of altitude-related health problems ranging from coughing up blood to severe, unshakable headache. He gave his blessing but acknowledged: “If you polled physicians you might have gotten a lot of different advice.” Another of Andy’s doctors, Dr. Zofia Piotrowska, a medical oncologist at Massachusetts General, said her team wanted to help him go where he wanted to go, knowing the trip’s meaning to him. However, if she thought the trip was a “medically very unsafe thing to do,” she’d have asked him not to go, she said. Dr. Piotrowska focuses on the type of lung cancer Andy has, which has a mutation in the gene called epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR. The EGFR subgroup represents about 15 percent of all non-small-cell lung cancers and is relatively common in “never smokers” like Andy. When he was given his diagnosis in 2014, he was treated with a first-generation EGFR inhibitor, an oral pill that turned off the mutant protein on the surface of the cancer cell. His response was swift, but the remission lasted less than a year. In 2016 he enrolled in his current trial after a biopsy showed his cancer had developed a specific mutation to resist the original drug he’d been on. A newly developed drug known as EGF816 targeted his acquired resistance. Within days of being treated, Andy noticed he was breathing better. He resumed his outdoor activities and adventures in the months to follow, doing more as his fitness improved. Dr. Piotrowska said that before clearing him for the climb, she thought his lung function was pretty close to normal. The question nobody could answer was how lungs that were once filled with cancer would tolerate altitude. Also unanswerable was how he’d respond to the exertion and stress of the expedition, which included waking in darkness in subzero temperatures and a 16-hour climb on summit day. Andy admitted that he was pleasantly surprised that his doctors signed off. His most recent scan had confirmed two small, slow-growing nodules, one on each lung. There were no immediate symptoms. “It’s not like we were told to expect these spots to blossom forth while he was gone,” his wife said. “If we had, it would’ve been an absolute no go.” A longtime ski mountaineering friend, Brian Lambert, invited Andy to join the trip. They felt he’d be in good hands: the lead guides were Jim Gudjonson, a longtime alpine guide on several of Andy’s previous trips, and Deryl Kelly, an Everest veteran and the head of Parks Canada rescue service who, as an E.M.T., would oversee the clients’ health on the mountain, along with a team physician. The trip itself was a test. Though Andy went at his own pace the opening week, staying mostly to the rear of the rest of the party as he combined walking steps with periodic “rest steps,” he struggled. He said he was within a day of letting the others advance on the summit without him when his stamina markedly improved. As they crossed the Mera glacier above 17,000 feet he found himself alongside the group’s faster members. Although it is poorly understood who acclimatizes well and who doesn’t, Andy said he found that he did better at higher altitudes. He likely also benefited from his superb technical skills in using crampons and ice tools on the high glacier. And he joked that he might have another useful mutation: “I seem to love a sufferfest.” In ascending on the final day — the climbers were tethered to one another with rope — Andy described the despair of a too-fast pace in the darkness melting in the uplift of a spectacular daybreak. The “beautiful crimson” lit up all the neighboring high peaks, including Everest. Last month he was among several Stage IV cancer patients invited to a small gathering in Boston of top Massachusetts General researchers who outlined their thinking on future therapies. The researchers were clearly energized by the presence of the pioneering patients. “This is an example,” Dr. Piotrowska said, “of something that none of us ever thought would be possible a few years ago.” ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

And while whisky is Scotland’s national drink to the world, to many locals, Irn Bru is a close second. The company that makes Irn Bru says it will reduce the amount of sugar in its iconic drink this month, a change that has caused an uproar among its large fan base. The change in recipe, widely attributed to a new soda tax that comes into force in Britain this year, has also led to reports of panic buying in Scottish supermarkets. “It’s one of our symbols of being unique and different in the way we feel about ourselves,” said Stephen M. Blythe, a technology lawyer in Glasgow. After he saw an announcement on the company’s website about the change in his favorite drink, he set up a Facebook page to try to stop the recipe alteration. He has since joined forces with another man who began a Change.org petition for the cause. Some have compared the recipe change to the “new Coke” blunder of 1985. At the time, Coca-Cola replaced its century-old formula with a sweeter drink, only to put “Classic Coke” back on the shelves less than three months later, after facing angry customer complaints. The makers of Irn Bru, in a series of candid communications with consumers on social media, responded promptly to the growing concerns. “We’ve done a shed-load of tests on this,” read one message from Irn Bru’s official Twitter account. “We hope you’ll agree it still tastes amazing.” But unlike the irritated Coke customers of three decades ago, Irn Bru’s fans have social media at their disposal, and opponents of the change have been vocal. The orange-colored fizz first had its debut in 1901 under the name Iron Brew from a secret recipe, known only to three people . The company’s former chairman still mixes the formula. The family-run company that manufactures the drink, A.G. Barr , renamed its beverage Irn Bru after World War II, when new British rules required names to reflect what products actually contained. The drink does contain ammonium ferric citrate , which is technically iron, but it is not brewed. The new name, however, didn’t keep the company from using a new slogan, later made famous by decades of advertising: “Irn Bru, made in Scotland from Girders,” pronounced with rolled Rs, of course. A spokesman for A.G. Barr said there have been recipe variations over the years, including during World War II, when sugar was in short supply, but they haven’t interfered with the original secret formula. The Irn Bru brand is closely associated with Scotland, and the company’s marketing has played on that persona for decades. Scotland — a largely self-governing entity within Britain with a strong independence movement — has a distinct national identity. Irn Bru is seen as quintessentially Scottish and associated with strength, but also with awkwardness and a wry sense of humor. “The sense of humor, everything that is baked into the Irn Bru personality, matches the Scottish persona,” said Mr. Blythe, the man behind the movement to keep the current recipe. While Scots are not the only ones who drink Irn Bru in Britain, sales of the drink soared in the British Parliament after the largest contingent yet of the Scottish National Party members won seats, The Guardian reported . It gave parliamentarians “sustenance,” one Scottish member said. Coke sold in Britain currently contains slightly more sugar than Irn Bru, with 35 grams of the white stuff in an average can, compared with Irn Bru’s 34 grams . The new recipe will contain around 15.5 grams in a can (which is still about 4 teaspoons). Some worry that cutting out the sugar will lessen Irn Bru’s purported hangover curative powers. Other popular drinks, like Dr Pepper, Fanta and Sprite, have lost up to 30 percent of their sugar content , to no apparent consumer uproar and without affecting sales . Even as some are lamenting the change in their favorite beverage, others see the reduction of sugar in Irn Bru as just a small step in the right direction. ', 0, 0, 5, 1);

That is when Oregon, the only other holdover from the full-service era of the 1970s, loosened its restrictions. Its new law allows residents of most counties with fewer than 40,000 people to fuel up their cars themselves. That leaves Jersey, only Jersey, with its dense tangle of highways and byways, its turnpike rest stops named for state luminaries and its status as the home of the first drive-in theater , as the sole state where it is illegal everywhere to fill your own tank 24 hours a day. It is a distinction that makes Declan J. O’Scanlon Jr., a state lawmaker, spout frustration by the gallon. “It’s ridiculous,” said Mr. O’Scanlon, a Republican assemblyman from Monmouth County who will soon take a seat in the State Senate. “If I want to pull in, get in and out quickly, I should be able to do so.” Mr. O’Scanlon said that he frequently pumps his own gas, ignoring the Retail Gasoline Dispensing Safety Act of 1949, the statute that first forbade civilians from putting their grubby hands on the nozzle. “I break the law in New Jersey on a regular basis,” he said. “Someone can come to my door and cuff me if they want.” Two years ago in the Assembly, Mr. O’Scanlon was one of several legislators to sponsor a bill allowing self-service stations. It stalled. One prominent opponent of the idea is the president of the State Senate, Stephen M. Sweeney, a Democrat, who remains immovable. In an emailed statement Friday, Mr. Sweeney said that he saw no good reason to change a system that worked. “When we have winters like the one this year, I don’t see many men and women who want to pump their own gas,” he said. “It’s something that makes New Jersey a little more unique and the people of New Jersey like it that way.” Polling and interviews suggest that the state’s natives agree. The actor Bobby Cannavale, who grew up in the state, said that it never bothers him, though he does forget every time he leaves and comes back, and has to be ushered back into his car by the attendant. He added that he sometimes gets nervous for a split second that he’ll never get his credit card back. “You’re sitting in your car just handing a guy your credit card,” he said. “He can hand it to another guy in another car and you’re done.” Chris Christie proposed self-serve gas during his gubernatorial campaign in 2009, but dropped the proposal because the negative response from the public was so ferocious. At a town hall-style meeting in 2016, he said that it was a gender issue, citing a poll that indicated that 78 percent of women in the state were only too happy to stay in their cars. Ashley Koning, the director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University, said in an interview that the idea of pumping one’s own gas had never been broadly favorable in New Jersey. “It’s kind of one of the third rails of state politics,” she said, noting that women and older people in particular enjoyed the service. A December 2015 Rutgers-Eagleton poll found that almost three-quarters of the state’s residents preferred to have gas pumped for them, and that 84 percent of women preferred the service. And when she takes off her polling hat, Ms. Koning said, she is one of those women. “As a Jersey Girl, I’m definitely not for it,” she said. “Jersey is very proud and one of the things it’s proud of is not having to pump its own gas.” Some pollsters have stopped asking the question altogether. Krista Jenkins, the director of Fairleigh Dickinson University’s polling unit, said that it had not come up since 2012 because “it hasn’t really been that much of a debate.” In that year, the university found that 63 percent of voters supported the law and only 23 percent opposed it, with a similarly exaggerated gender gap. Ms. Jenkins grew up in Southern California, and pumped her own gas. “But,” she said, “in the dead of winter when you don’t have to get out of your car, it’s a lovely feature of living in the state.” The response of some Oregon residents to that state’s loosening of restrictions may not encourage change in Jersey. A widely shared tweet highlighted comments on a local news story from Medford, in Jackson County, Oregon. Among residents’ concerns were “smelling of gas when I get it on my hands or clothes” and the potential health effects of breathing in small amounts over time. New Jersey legislators cited safety concerns when they passed the original law that barred residents from pumping gas almost 70 years ago. But when gas station owners challenged the ban in 1951, the state’s Supreme Court ruled that self-serve was indeed “dangerous in use.” And the ban held up, despite attempts to fight it in the 1980s. In the rest of the country, self-service stations became the norm. Safer unleaded gasoline became more common, thanks to federal regulations, as did pumps that accepted credit cards. In most of the United States, that spelled the end of an era when attendants offered to wipe your windshield and check your oil while the tank filled up and you fumbled for a tip. Mr. O’Scanlon is undeterred by the dual weights of history and public opinion. He said that he may bring a new proposal this year, just to keep the conversation alive. He said that economic arguments about jobs and safety are absurd, given that drivers in other states have been pumping their own gas for decades and lived to tell the tale. “The only thing you could argue is that New Jerseyans are more flammable than people in the other 49 states,” he said. “Because we eat so much oily pizza, funnel cake and fries, maybe you could make that argument. Otherwise, it’s simply ridiculous.” ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

As many as 11 million Americans “could find coverage under this proposal,” the Labor Department said in issuing the proposed rules, which carry out an executive order signed by President Trump on Oct. 12 . The public will have 60 days to comment on the proposal before the Trump administration adopts final rules with the force of law. The proposal would allow small business owners, their employees, sole proprietors and other self-employed people to join together as a single group to buy insurance in the large-group market. The new health plans could be exempt from some requirements of the Affordable Care Act. They would, for example, not have to provide certain “essential health benefits” like mental health care, emergency services, maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs. “By joining together,” the Labor Department said, “employers may reduce administrative costs through economies of scale, strengthen their bargaining position to obtain more favorable deals, enhance their ability to self-insure and offer a wider array of insurance options.” But consumer groups, state officials and Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans have strenuously opposed similar ideas for years. Association health plans, they say, will tend to attract employers with younger, healthier workers, leaving behind sicker people in more comprehensive, more expensive plans that fully comply with the Affordable Care Act. That could drive up premiums, which already have risen steadily as Republicans have taken aim at President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement. “Those with serious health conditions like cancer would be left paying ever-increasing premiums for comprehensive coverage,” said Chris Hansen, the president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. “The rule proposed today will almost certainly result in more people facing financial distress when an unexpected health crisis happens.” Similar health plans have a history of fraud and abuse that have left employers and employees with hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid medical bills. Marc I. Machiz, who investigated insurance fraud as a Labor Department lawyer for more than 20 years, said the proposed rules were an invitation to more scams. “Any idiot with a word processor can create an association in 10 minutes and market it to small employers and individuals who certify that they are self-employed,” Mr. Machiz said. “The employers and individuals will pay premiums. By the time they discover they’ve been sold a fraudulent product, the promoter will be on his way to the Caribbean.” But two influential trade groups that could potentially sponsor the new health plans, the National Restaurant Association and the National Retail Federation, welcomed the proposed rules. The proposal deals another blow to the Affordable Care Act just two weeks after Mr. Trump signed tax legislation that will eliminate penalties for people who go without health insurance . Republicans in Congress have been trying for two decades to promote association health plans through legislation. The House passed a bill that included such plans in 1998, but it died in the Senate. President George W. Bush proposed them in 2003 and 2004. The House passed a bill to encourage them last March. And Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, has championed a similar bill in the Senate. Now the Trump administration says it will use its regulatory authority to accomplish what Congress could not. The proposal offers a new interpretation of “employer” and other terms in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the framework for employer-sponsored health plans covering tens of millions of Americans. Mr. Trump had ordered the Labor Department to develop the rules as a way to provide insurance options for consumers and small businesses that he said would cost less because they would be “exempt from the onerous and expensive insurance mandates” in the 2010 health law. Mr. Paul praised the rules, saying they would “allow more Americans to join in groups to purchase lower-cost health insurance across state lines.” In response to critics, the Trump administration said that its proposal included some protections for consumers: “Small business health plans (association health plans) cannot charge individuals higher premiums based on health factors or refuse to admit employees to a plan because of health factors,” such as a physical or mental illness, disability, claims history or genetic information. The rules would expand the types of groups that could form association health plans and would allow for membership across state lines. Employers around the country could, for example, band together if they were in “the same trade, industry, line of business or profession” but had no other connections to one another. Likewise, employers in the same state, region or metropolitan area could form a group health plan. For many years, the department has required a much greater “commonality of interest” among small businesses that wanted to be treated as a large group when buying insurance. To qualify under current rules, small businesses generally must have some purpose and relationship “unrelated to the provision of benefits.” William G. Schiffbauer, a lawyer who specializes in insurance and employee benefits, said Thursday that the rules would “overturn years of advisory opinions from the Labor Department.” If the agency adopts this proposal as a final rule, he said, “it will very likely be challenged in the federal courts, delaying implementation” and shifting attention back to Congress. The department said its new interpretation of the 1974 law, known as Erisa, was justified by “the need to expand access to health care” and respond to “changing market dynamics.” The rules would make new insurance options available to “the millions of uninsured Americans who are sole proprietors or the family of sole proprietors,” the department said. When he signed the executive order in October, Mr. Trump said the rules would provide millions of Americans with relief from “the disaster of Obamacare.” In addition, the Labor Department said Thursday, association health plans could give small businesses relief from some state insurance rules that restrict “product offerings and pricing.” Under the rules, association health plans could buy commercial insurance or serve as their own insurers, paying claims directly from the plan’s assets. Some people who now obtain coverage in the Affordable Care Act marketplace could instead join association health plans. In an interview last week with The New York Times , Mr. Trump suggested that the new policy had been put into effect, but that is not the case. “We’ve created associations, millions of people are joining associations,” he said in the interview. “Millions. That were formerly in Obamacare or didn’t have insurance. Or didn’t have health care. Millions of people.” The department acknowledged that association health plans had a history of financial mismanagement and abuse. Some plans, it said, “have failed to pay promised health benefits to sick and injured workers while diverting, to the pockets of fraudsters, employer and employee contributions from their intended purpose of funding benefits.” The department said it now had the authority to prevent such abuses. But former employees said the department’s enforcement apparatus had been weakened by budget cuts and could not adequately police compliance. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

A flu outbreak, colder weather and high levels of respiratory illness have put an unusually severe strain on the N.H.S. this winter, forcing the service to postpone thousands of nonurgent surgeries and outpatient appointments to free up hospital beds and staff. And all that comes against a backdrop of years of austerity-driven budget restraints, as well as staffing shortages that many health experts attribute to the anti-immigrant atmosphere fostered by Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, which is driving foreign health care workers back to their home countries. In several emergency wards across the country, patients are having to wait more than 12 hours before they are tended to by a health professional. Hospital corridors are brimming with patients waiting for wards to be freed up, and nonurgent cases are being referred to pharmacies or general practitioners. Christmas week, over 4,700 people were stuck in ambulances for more than an hour while they waited for space in hospital wards, news agencies reported. On Wednesday, Mrs. May denied that there was a crisis and said that the N.H.S. was better prepared for winter than “ever before,” adding that extra funding had been infused to meet the higher demands of the winter. But the $2.2 billion increase she referred to fell far short of the $5.4 billion that Simon Stevens, the chief executive of the service, requested last year. Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, said Mrs. May’s apology was not good enough and blamed her Conservative Party for the crisis. “Nurses, doctors and patients are pleading with her to properly fund our health service, but she is ignoring them,” he tweeted on Thursday. He told the House of Commons last month that hospitals’ four-hour waiting time targets had not been met for over two years. The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, also apologized to patients facing delays. “It is absolutely not what I want,” he said. “There are real pressures, no doubt about it.

His meandering comments about health care and “associations” were confusing, and not totally accurate . But, in his remarks to Michael Schmidt of The New York Times , Mr. Trump previewed several tenets of a major regulation that was proposed by his Department of Labor on Thursday. And he articulated how the rule could interact with other health policy changes — and the consequences that could follow. Since his days as a candidate, Mr. Trump has consistently said that he wants to expand insurance access across state lines . And he has repeatedly argued that the decline and failure of Obamacare’s insurance markets would spur Democrats to come to the table and negotiate on some new plan. Thursday’s rule, amid other recent changes, aligns with both of those goals. The proposed rule is designed to make it easier for groups of individuals and small businesses to band together and buy the kind of insurance that large companies offer their workers. That kind of insurance is regulated under federal labor law and isn’t subject to all the requirements and consumer protections that apply to individual and small business insurance under Obamacare. Here’s what Mr. Trump said last week: As the proposal itself notes, “millions” of people might sign up for association plans, which could be made available to people who currently get insurance through a small business policy or buy it for themselves on the individual insurance market, as well as many people who currently lack health insurance. The Department of Labor identifies about 44 million people that it thinks would be eligible. (Fifty percent of the people is a stretch.) Those people include self-employed business owners who buy their own insurance, people in the small group insurance market, and people who do not get insurance, but might, if their company could find a cheaper option. The association rule is also likely to combine with other policy changes, as Mr. Trump notes. Congress recently repealed the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate , which means that Americans who decline to buy insurance won’t face a penalty, beginning next year. Another regulation is expected soon that would permit insurers to offer short-term plans for longer periods, perhaps for a year. Mr. Trump is right that the associations are part of a larger set of policies meant to chip away at Obamacare, and are likely to destabilize its markets for individual and small business insurance. The degree of disruption these policies will cause remains unclear. But they are likely to work together. The individual mandate is believed to have pushed some healthy, reluctant shoppers to buy insurance, and they may no longer feel the nudge when it goes away. The rise of short-term policies that cover fewer benefits and charge higher prices to sick customers might pull some healthier customers out of the Obamacare markets. And the association plans, which, under the proposal, would be open to small businesses and self-employed sole proprietors, may also pull some healthier, younger customers from Obamacare plans. As Alice Ollstein at Talking Points Memo noted on Thursday , the rule says that the individual mandate will mitigate negative effects from associations and then mentions in a footnote that the mandate will go away next year. (That’s just one of a few conflicts and factual errors in the proposal.) Under the proposal, which may face legal challenges, associations aren’t allowed to explicitly discriminate against individual applicants on the basis of their health history. But experts say there are a number of subtle tools they can use to attract healthy customers and shun sick ones. Associations may become a more attractive coverage option for industries with lots of young, healthy workers — say, dog walkers — and less attractive for industries where workers are older and sicker, like, say, roofers. That’s because Obamacare premiums are designed to be the same for everyone who signs up, regardless of their health status. Over all, healthier people tend to pay more in the current market than they would in an association of similar people, but sicker people don’t. The association plans for workers in a shared industry could be across state lines, in keeping with Mr. Trump’s goal. The rule also allows associations to set geographic limitations on enrollment, allowing unrelated businesses in a similar geographic area to join together. (Rural areas, which tend to be expensive , could be excluded.) In many cases, associations would also be free to customize their benefits packages, and avoid covering expensive treatments. A plan that doesn’t cover substance-abuse treatment or medications for rheumatoid arthritis might be cheaper, but would push people who know they need those therapies into the Obamacare market instead, where all plans have to cover a set of “essential health benefits.” Most dog walkers who do not have arthritis or psychiatric illnesses may not mind — or even notice, unless their health status changes. Some proponents of the package of Trump administration policies say they will not make a big enough difference to upend the markets that remain, but say that the new options will provide more affordable coverage to people who have stayed uninsured under the current system. But Obamacare advocates are very worried. Mr. Trump has said many times that Obamacare’s death would bring about cooperation from Democrats in creating an alternative. In his Times interview, he specifically says that the policy brew of associations and mandate repeal could be what it takes to prompt bipartisan compromise. “I believe that because of the individual mandate and the associations, the Democrats will and certainly should come to me and see if they can do a really great health care plan for the remaining people,” he said.

Does magnesium help you sleep? A. Studies have found a link between low levels of magnesium, an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in a wide range of bodily processes, and sleep disorders. But if you are concerned you aren’t getting enough magnesium, changing your diet may be a better option than taking a supplement, as “there is really sparse evidence that taking super-therapeutic doses of magnesium will give you a benefit,” said Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a professor of pulmonary and sleep medicine at the University of Southern California. The mineral is widely available in both plant and animal-based foods, and the kidneys limit urinary excretion of magnesium, so deficiencies are rare in healthy people. Leafy green vegetables, nuts, legumes and whole grains are good sources of magnesium; fish, chicken and beef also contain magnesium. Older adults and people with certain disorders, such as Type 2 diabetes, gastrointestinal diseases and alcoholism, however, may have inadequate amounts. “Magnesium deficiency has been associated with higher levels of stress, anxiety and difficulty relaxing, which are key ingredients to getting good sleep at night,” Dr. Dasgupta said. He noted that magnesium interacts with an important neurotransmitter that favors sleep. One small double-blinded clinical trial of 43 elderly people in Tehran who were randomly assigned to receive either 500 milligrams of magnesium or a placebo for eight weeks found that those who received the supplement fell asleep faster and spent more of their time in bed asleep, but their total sleep time was not necessarily longer. An even smaller study of 10 people done nearly 20 years ago found that taking a magnesium supplement helped people with restless leg syndrome get more sleep. If you suspect you’re deficient in magnesium or want to take magnesium supplements, talk to your doctor first. Magnesium can interact poorly with other drugs, and taking excessive amounts in the form of supplements can cause stomach cramps, diarrhea and nausea. Including more leafy green vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds and whole grains in your diet may be a better option, doctors say. Do you have a health question? Ask Well ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

The American Cancer Society predicts that in 2018, there will be 1,735,350 new cases of cancer and 609,640 deaths. The latest report on cancer statistics appears in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians. The most common cancers — in men, tumors of the prostate; in women, breast — are not the most common causes of cancer death. Although prostate cancer accounts for 19 percent of cancers in men and breast cancer for 30 percent of cancers in women, the most common cause of cancer death in both sexes is lung cancer, which accounts for one-quarter of cancer deaths in both sexes. In women, 14 percent of deaths are from breast cancer, 7 percent from pancreatic cancer, and 5 percent from cancer of the ovaries. In men, prostate cancer causes 9 percent of deaths, while 7 percent are due to pancreatic cancer and 6 percent to liver cancer. In both sexes, 8 percent of deaths are from colon and rectal cancer. Cancer incidence in men rose sharply in the 1990s because of the widespread use of P.S.A. testing, which detected large numbers of asymptomatic prostate cancers. Rates of lung cancer in women are now approaching the levels in men. Over the past decade, cancer incidence in men has dropped by about 2 percent a year, while it has remained the same in women. There are two reasons, researchers said. First, there has been a decline in male lung cancer because fewer men are smoking, and a decline in colorectal cancer because of men’s increasing use of colonoscopy. Second, from 2008 to 2013, prostate cancer diagnoses declined with the decreasing use of P.S.A. testing. “We’re making progress in reducing death rates from cancer because of improvements in treatment and early detection,” said the senior author, Ahmedin Jemal, a vice president of the American Cancer Society. “But prevention is the low-hanging fruit.

But decades after researchers first examined it, a group of scientists has taken another look at the toddler’s remains and discovered that it most likely suffered from a different scourge: the hepatitis B virus. The finding, published Thursday in the journal PLOS Pathogens , provides further evidence that the hepatitis B virus has afflicted humans for centuries. Today more than 250 million people live with the virus worldwide and it killed nearly 900,000 people in 2015, mostly through liver disease, according to the World Health Organization . “This very common and nasty bug has been with us at least 500 years, and I suspect it may have been here many, many thousands of years,” said Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Sydney and an author on the paper. The mummified child, who died at two years old, was buried in the Basilica of Saint Domenico Maggiore in Naples during the 16th century. The researchers who have worked there acknowledge some of the emotional challenges to studying the toddler’s remains. “There’s this hollowness yet this ghostlike pain still there which is fascinating from a scientific perspective but horrific from a parental perspective,” said Hendrik Poinar, an evolutionary geneticist at McMaster University in Ontario and an author of the recent paper. In the crypt, the child’s coffin rests near dozens of other wooden burial boxes, some of which held the bodies of Aragonese princes and Neapolitan nobles. Their corpses were clothed in decorated woven fabrics and precious silk. Many were embalmed but some were naturally mummified by the dry conditions of the basilica. “The mummies of San Domenico Maggiore are unique in Italy not only for the antiquity and excellent state of preservation of the bodies,” Gino Fornaciari, a paleopathologist at the University of Pisa and an author of the paper, said in an email, “but also for the fame of the personages, whose lives and causes of death are well known.” Dr. Fornaciari first studied the child mummy in the 1980s. Using an electron microscope he found what he thought were traces of smallpox , also known as variola virus, in its remains. Since then the child has served as a quintessential example of early European smallpox. That made it a prime target for Dr. Holmes and his colleagues who have tried to map out the timeline and diversity of the smallpox virus. In 2016, Dr. Holmes and his team had found traces of smallpox in a 17th century Lithuanian mummy . By re-examining the Naples mummy with molecular tools, they expected to push back the timeline of smallpox in Europe another hundred years. “That was the hope, that this would be a slam dunk,” Dr. Poinar said. “But it’s never a slam dunk when you think it’s a slam dunk.” Instead, when they sequenced the genome of the child mummy and performed their molecular analysis they found no trace of the smallpox virus. But they did find evidence of the hepatitis B virus. At first they did not pay much attention to the finding. Then they realized that a symptom of hepatitis B infection in children is a facial rash called Gianotti-Crosti syndrome . They thought perhaps the hepatitis B virus caused the dots on the child’s mummified face. They performed another molecular analysis and found that the genetic information they the extracted from the ancient hepatitis B virus resembled that of a modern-day hepatitis B virus genome. To the researchers, that was a red flag for contamination. They spent the next year and a half trying to figure out whether they had actually found traces of ancient hepatitis B virus, or whether instead the virus they found was a contaminant from one of the researchers who uncovered the mummy in the 1980s. As hepatitis B infections were common in Italy at that time, Dr. Poinar said it was possible that the virus signals they saw were from contamination. Further analysis showed that the genetic material from the hepatitis B virus they found on the mummy was damaged in much the same way that genetic information from the mummy itself was damaged. That indicated that it was similarly as old. But to further corroborate their hunch, the team performed an evolutionary analysis using several other old strains of hepatitis B virus, and found that the virus itself evolves very slowly. That suggests that in a period of about 500 years, the hepatitis B virus has not changed much. Dr. Poinar and Dr. Holmes said they are confident that they found perhaps the earliest evidence of hepatitis B infection in Italy, but would not completely rule out the possibility of contamination. “I’m 80-20 at this point, or maybe 90-10, that it’s not contamination,” Dr. Poinar said.

The brainchild of a research project financed by the Canadian government on how to prevent excessive drinking, the labels warned of the health risks of alcohol consumption and were meant to be in place for eight months as an experiment. But within a month, the experiment was halted. The government stopped affixing the labels after several alcohol industry lobbying groups challenged both the research study and the legality of the government’s participation. John Streicker, the member of the Yukon government’s cabinet responsible for the territory’s liquor stores, said he believed that the government faced litigation if it continued to use the researchers’ labels. With a population of 36,000, the territory is not in a financial position to take on the global alcohol industry in court, he added. “The costs that we could be facing are significant,” Mr. Streicker said. “We need to do the responsible thing, which is to judge whether that’s the best use of our money for our citizens. The hard choice is whether to pay for lawyers or whether to pay for harm reduction.” Lobbying groups representing Canada’s breweries, wineries and distilleries, Mr. Streicker said, suggested that the labels might harm their brands and asked about the territory’s legal right to apply them. The industry also suggested that putting stickers on their bottles and cans infringed trademarks, he said. In interviews on Wednesday, the presidents of Beer Canada, the brewers’ trade group, and of the Association of Canadian Distillers, said they had not threatened legal action. But Jan H. Westcott, the president and chief executive of the distillers’ group, repeatedly criticized the validity of the information on the labels and the work of the researchers themselves. “I don’t think that the way that they’ve approached it is actually going to provide results that are useful or legitimate necessarily,” Mr. Westcott said of the peer-reviewed study. Mr. Streicker said, “If it was to go to court I think they would use all avenues open to them to try and challenge this study.” The label experiment was part of a four-year-old project led by Erin Hobin, a scientist at the province of Ontario’s public health agency, in cooperation with the University of Victoria in British Columbia. The research is financed by Health Canada, a federal department. The sale of alcohol is controlled by provincial and territorial governments and, in most of Canada, largely sold through government-owned stores. Tim Stockwell, the director of the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research at the University of Victoria, who is also involved in the project, said Yukon’s alcohol retailer was the only one in Canada willing to test the stickers. Yukon has the highest per capita sales of alcohol in the country, adding to the researchers’ interest. Focus groups with drinkers were held over about two years within Whitehorse, the capital of the Yukon. Dr. Hobin said they showed strong support for health warnings on liquor bottles. “There is just very low availability of information about health hazards around alcohol,” said Dr. Hobin, whose research indicated that three-quarters of drinkers in the Yukon were not aware of the link between some cancers and alcohol. In November, the American Society of Clinical Oncology released a statement indicating that even light drinking could slightly increase a woman’s risk of breast cancer and increased the chances of developing a common form of esophageal cancer. Alcohol was first linked to a variety of cancers by a branch of the World Health Organization in 1987. The plan was to stick labels on the bottles for eight months and then use sales data and follow-up interviews to assess their effect on drinking. Liquor stores and drinkers in the neighboring Northwest Territories would have been a control group. Yukon has been putting stickers about drinking during pregnancy on alcohol for nearly 30 years. The study’s labels, however, were larger and more brightly colored than the previous ones used in Yukon liquor stores. One offered a slimmed-down version of Canada’s alcohol drinking guidelines, which were developed with the alcohol industry’s participation. The other warned that alcohol can cause cancer. Dr. Hobin said their designs were influenced by Canada’s mandatory warnings for cigarette packages that featured grisly photos of smoking-related diseases. But in comparison, the alcohol labels are subdued. While the territory’s stickers about drinking during pregnancy never attracted attention from the alcohol industry, Mr. Streicker, the Yukon government official, said he soon heard about the study’s labels. Mr. Westcott, the president of the distillers’ group, said, “We think these are pretty complex issues and simply putting them on a label is not necessarily the best way to do that,” adding that he did not think that Whitehorse was an appropriate place for the study because of its comparatively small population and remoteness. Luke Harford, the president of the brewers’ lobbying group, said he was concerned that some shoppers might conclude that the label about the drinking guidelines — which recommends abstinence twice a week — could be misinterpreted as a safe amount of drinking before driving. As for the other label, Mr. Harford said, “It’s this very alarming statement that this is going to cause cancer.” Although both Mr. Harford and Mr. Westcott said they never suggested that their organizations or their members would sue if the labeling continued, they also acknowledged that they asked, as Mr. Westcott put it, “what legal authority they had to put the labels on the products.” The government, he said, has not “provided that information.” Dr. Stockwell of the research project said the federal government, the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia and his university also received complaints from the alcohol industry. Robert Solomon, a professor of law at the University of Western Ontario in London who has specialized in drug and alcohol policy for more than 40 years, said rulings by the Supreme Court of Canada about warnings on cigarette packages clearly gave the Yukon government the right to add its labels. He dismissed the idea of trademark or defamation lawsuits as “without merit.” “It’s somewhat sad that the industry opposes making consumers aware of the harms related to alcohol,” Professor Soloman said. “The alcohol industry doesn’t really want the public to look at alcohol as a drug. It’s a drug that imposes health costs.” ', 0, 0, 5, 1);

You may have seen the commercials. Because of Humira, a woman with rheumatoid arthritis can wash her puppy in the bathtub, another with colitis can stroll happily through a fair packed with food vendors, while a third suffering from psoriasis can go to the gym without hiding her neck. But they probably wouldn’t all look so relieved if they saw the bill. The price of Humira, an anti-inflammatory drug dispensed in an injectable pen, has risen from about $19,000 a year in 2012, to more than $38,000 today, per patient, after rebates, according to SSR Health, a research firm. That’s an increase of 100 percent. Pharma bosses probably miss Martin Shkreli, the reigning villain of the industry. If you’ll recall, Mr. Shkreli, as chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, acquired Daraprim, a drug used to fight infections in AIDS patients, and then raised the price overnight to $750 a pill from $13.50. He also trolled critics and spent $2 million on a one-of-a-kind Wu Tang Clan album, before his conviction on three securities fraud charges last year. For a time, Mr. Shkreli’s antics, along with the soaring price of EpiPens , sold by Mylan, deflected attention from the rest of the industry. A more typical play for drug companies — the Humira play — is to start at a high price and keep raising it ever higher, but incrementally. “What they have done with Humira is just as unfair, just as morally wrong, but they did it over five years,” said Ben Wakana, a former Obama administration spokesman who became executive director of Patients for Affordable Drugs, an advocacy group, because his younger brother couldn’t afford Humira without the financial support of their parents. “People are skipping doses, people are rationing, people are going into bankruptcy because of this drug,” he said in an interview, arguing that Humira is both more expensive per dose and has a far higher volume than Daraprim. AbbVie, which was spun off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013, declined to comment. How much you actually pay out of pocket, and whether you can afford Humira at all, depend on your insurance and eligibility for discounts. Anne Marie Garza, 51, an administrative assistant in Houston who suffers from colitis and Crohn’s disease, said she had held off buying her latest dose because her insurer had changed. She was trying to see if she could avoid an out-of-pocket payment of more than $1,200, one of two she would have to make this year, on top of her rising expenses for vitamins and supplements to manage the disease. She has relatively good insurance, but the payments will strain her budget. “During the holidays, I was contemplating what am I’m going to do,” she said. “I was thinking should I just go on a liquid diet, because I can’t afford this.” It’s a difficult choice. “It does give you your life back,” she said of the drug. “I literally couldn’t go away from the house or very far from a bathroom, 20, 25 times in the bathroom all day long, I can’t imagine living like that,” she said, adding, “I was becoming a hermit because I was so sick.” Humira, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of AbbVie’s $25.6 billion in revenue in 2016, was not simple to develop. It is among a new class of drugs known as biologics, which are made from living cells rather than synthetic chemicals. The industry has argued that high American prices are needed to fund drug development, but a 2016 study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association found “no evidence of an association between research and development costs and prices; rather, prescription drugs are priced in the United States primarily on the basis of what the market will bear.” Competitive pressures have been muted. Copies of biologic drugs, known as biosimilars, are not as easy to produce as normal generic drugs, and AbbVie’s aggressive patent strategy has allowed it to further push off rivals. While there are name brand competitors to Humira, they are not exactly alike, complicating efforts by doctors or insurers to switch a patient from one drug to another. Looking at the international picture tells its own story about drug costs. A prefilled carton with two syringes costs $2,669 in the United States, compared with $1,362 in Britain, $822 in Switzerland and $552 in South Africa, according to a 2015 report from the International Federation of Health Plans. “You’ve got the largest market for pharmaceuticals, which has the highest prices,” said Christopher Raymond, senior biotech analyst at Piper Jaffray. “That doesn’t make any sense.” But it is typical. Other countries have single-payer systems, like Britain’s National Health Service, that negotiate with drug companies or governments that exert price controls. AbbVie has put some of its earnings to work lobbying against efforts at price controls in the United States, recently in California . The industry also successfully lobbied in 2006 to bar Medicare from negotiating over drug prices. While President Trump once talked about taking action on drug prices, his administration did not follow through in the health care debate last year. By contrast, Britain’s National Health Service, while strained of late , has more formidable negotiating leverage. “I do think we need something like that in the United States, not the N.H.S. broadly, but some means of dealing with the extreme pricing instances,” said Richard Evans, founder of SSR Health. An analysis by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review found that Humira’s list price would need to be discounted by at least 55 percent to be cost effective for rheumatoid arthritis, its originally approved use. Dr. Steven D. Pearson, the founder of the institute, which provides cost benefit data to health plans, said competing drugs were overpriced as well. “Even in a space like this, where there is a lot of competition, we don’t see the prices coming down,” he said. “That speaks to the fact that it doesn’t often function like a free market usually would.” For now, Americans have to rely on the generosity of the drug industry, such as it is. I took a spin through AbbVie’s corporate Code of Conduct, entitled “ Inspired by Integrity .” It’s a lofty document. “WE ARE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING PATIENTS’ LIVES,” it says, in all caps. It even makes a point of saying that AbbVie supports the United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights . That declaration, if you read it, says, “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care.” AbbVie joined a few of its rivals in saying it would limit price increases to single digits this year, and so only raised Humira by another 9.7 percent this month, roughly four and a half times the inflation rate. For the drug industry, that counts as generosity. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

At most, 15 people stayed, he said, adding that he remained up all night to supervise the gathering. But city officials on Friday said the arrangement was unlawful and a zoning and public safety issue, as well as a property maintenance issue. Mr. Schiller’s property did not comply with codes and regulations, a city spokeswoman, Molly Center, said on Friday. It lacked adequate light and ventilation and there were insufficient exits in the event of a fire, she said. Emergency shelters are not permitted in residences, Laura Valdez, the assistant city manager, said Friday. “He has a big heart, and it’s very admirable, but there are other shelters that are in place that are lawful,” she said. “And we have a relationship with them to provide a safe space.” Jeff Rowes, a senior lawyer who focuses on private property rights and free speech at the Institute for Justice , a public interest law firm, said he believed the city may have overstepped its bounds. “Both Greg and the homeless people he helps have a constitutional right to be free of government interference that endangers their lives,” he said on Friday. Mr. Rowes, who has been in contact with Mr. Schiller, said Mr. Schiller constitutionally may have a “right to rescue,” in that he has a right to offer lifesaving services to people in danger, and that he should not be subject to “irrational zoning.” Blindly enforcing rules in a way that is divorced from real-time problems is unacceptable, Mr. Rowes said. “Abuse of zoning and code enforcement is a plague, particularly a plague on low-income people,” he said. Mr. Schiller was opening his home only in emergency situations, Mr. Rowes said, adding, “He’s not trying to run a clandestine homeless shelter 24/7.” Elgin, a city of about 110,000, has three lawful shelters, two of which work together to offer 24-hour service year-round. Several warming centers become available during extreme cold and there is also an emergency shelter operated by the nonprofit Matthew 25:40 . It only opens when the temperature drops to 15 degrees or lower, Tammy Wheatly, the shelter’s executive director, said Friday. On the nights that Mr. Schiller opened his home, the temperatures were above 15 degrees but still below freezing. “We have shelters, but they’re not always open,” Mr. Schiller told AM 560. “All I’m doing is trying to fill a gap in the wintertime.” Mr. Schiller, the managing director of the Light in the Darkness Ministry, was a founding member of Matthew 25:40. He resigned in November 2016 amid conflict with the organization. “He had a my-way-or-the-highway attitude and refused to seek approval or input from the board,” Ms. Wheatly said. Mr. Schiller did not respond to a call seeking comment on Friday. Traditional shelters require those seeking housing to meet certain requirement, but they are not that stringent, said Sarah J. Ponitz, the executive director of PADS of Elgin , the overnight shelter that operates all year. These individuals need some type of photo identification, but it doesn’t have to be state issued, she said. They also have to have some type of community connection to prove they are in the shelter’s service area. Almost no one is turned away, regardless of substance abuse or mental health issues, Ms. Ponitz said. Ms. Ponitz said there were many reasons, some complex, as to why homeless people might opt to go to a private home instead of a lawful shelter. Some don’t feel that they need help, she said, and some want to drink or use drugs, which are not permitted in shelters. PADS is rarely at capacity, Ms. Ponitz said. “It’s unfair to say there’s nowhere else to go,” she said. This is not the first time Mr. Schiller has been ordered to close a makeshift shelter at his home. He opened his garage to homeless people last winter, he told AM 560. He set up propane heaters and cracked open the garage door, but had to call emergency services after one man with a heart condition fell ill. Emergency medical technicians reported him for violating zoning code, he said. The city was tipped off to the recent situation by an anonymous complaint, Ms. Valdez said. Mr. Schiller said it wasn’t filed by his neighbors, who he said supported his efforts. “We believe that the complaint came from someone who has a personal ax to grind with me that doesn’t live near here,” he said.

But when I read this chilling passage — “I am dementing. I am dementing. I am dementing.” — from Gerda Saunders’s recent memoir “Memory’s Last Breath: Field Notes on My Dementia,” I found myself starting to panic. In a world increasingly dominated by the Google/Apple/Facebook/Amazon hegemony, we hear a lot about the threat to privacy. But isn’t memory just as vulnerable? Now that, as the former New Republic editor Franklin Foer writes in “World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech,” “our phone is an extension of our memory; we’ve outsourced basic functions to algorithms,” doesn’t the world seem like an ever-larger parking lot that has mysteriously swallowed our Toyota? Don’t we all wish, now more than ever, that acquaintances came equipped with their own “Previously on this series …” trailer? Mr. Foer and Ms. Saunders aren’t the only writers on this beat. Recent books by Robert Sapolsky, Michael Lemonick, Felicia Yap, Emily Barr, Dale Bredesen, Val Emmich, Oliver Sacks and Elizabeth Rosner, among others, have addressed the theme of non-historical memory. Last July alone, more than a dozen books specifically about the topic, most of them self-published, were released. You’d expect the themes of amnesia or powers of recall to be prevalent in thrillers or in memoirs by trauma survivors or over-beveraged rock stars, but even literary fiction is getting in on the act. In Rachel Khong’s sly, diaristic “Goodbye, Vitamin,” a 30-year-old who moves back home learns she has to care for a dementing father who has started leaving his pants in trees. In Alissa Nutting’s outrageous sex comedy “Made for Love,” a woman on the lam from her tech pioneer husband discovers that he has implanted a chip in her brain that allows him to download all her experiences. A majority of the recent or upcoming books about the topic, though, are nonfiction works that take a prescriptive approach to memory loss. I recently spent a month trying to follow the dictates of two of them, both written by doctors: Daniel G. Amen’s “Memory Rescue: Supercharge Your Brain, Reverse Memory Loss and Remember What Matters Most” and Andrew E. Budson and Maureen K. O’Connor’s “Seven Steps to Managing Your Memory: What’s Normal, What’s Not, and What to Do About It.” The first thing I noticed about these two workbook-type tomes is, because they’re not intended to be read straight through, they repeat information so frequently as to render a reader frantic about his mental health. I kept wanting to ask Dr. Amen, a physician with his own chain of clinics: Didn’t you pimp turmeric 10 pages ago? Before reading the books, I’d taken eight memory tests that I’d found on various websites, to get a baseline of my powers of recall. Consolingly, I’d tested slightly above average for my age. But once turmeric started to ominously reappear, I felt like Jennifer Lawrence in “Mother.” On the diet and exercise front, the two books were mostly in agreement: Strangely, neither wants you to lie on the couch while idly nursing a stick of French butter. (But take heart, both books want you to eat a little dark chocolate each day. Mr. Budson and Ms. O’Connor, who teach neurology at Boston University, don’t even stipulate that it needs to be unsweetened.) For me, the doctors’ bodily prescriptions fell into two categories: Things I Already Do, and Things I Can’t Be Bothered to Change. On the former front: I dance two hours a week, walk briskly 30 minutes a day and consume a lot of vegetables and water but not much alcohol or butter. On the latter: Hands off my trusty colleagues caffeine and baked goods, not to mention my occasional visitors, Mr. Charred Meats and Ms. Marijuana. When it came to recommended activities, this Scrabble enthusiast was dismayed to learn from Mr. Budson and Ms. O’Connor that “there is not currently strong enough evidence for us to suggest the use of brain-training games.” Rather, they encourage you to learn new skills or information while being social. To this end, I took an Iyengar yoga class. I chatted up a friend about the recent Mayweather-McGregor boxing bout. I had a CVS employee show me how to use a price scanner, and a church employee tell me what an undercroft is. (“Are we in the undercroft now?” I asked him. “Yes, we’re in the undercroft,” he told me. I felt like I’d wandered into a young adult novel about hot, troubled teens who foil the time-space continuum.) In a similar vein, Dr. Amen encourages you to undertake various activities while using your non-dominant hand. Slight splattery mayhem ensued in my kitchen one night when I tried to slice 30 or so cherry tomatoes in half with my left hand for a salad. It looked like an audience at La Scala had had very strong feelings about our floor tiles. Two of the books’ dictates seemed like they were demonstrably working. First, Dr. Amen recommends that you spend 15 minutes a day in deep prayer or meditation, which “reliably activates the prefrontal cortex.” Of the 30 days I tried meditating — I stare at a spot on the wall, and repeatedly clear my mind — I was unable to focus eight times and fell asleep once. But two of the sessions led to the most productive workdays I’ve had all year. I also noticed good results with memorization techniques wherein you create images in your mind. One of these is a rhyme that runs, “One is a bun, two is a shoe, three is a tree” and so on up to 10. Thus, if given a list of words to memorize that starts “sally, smokey, desperate,” I’d first imagine the “All in the Family” co-star Sally Struthers bursting from a hot dog bun; then a pair of shoes being barbecued; and then a tree whose roots spell out “kill me now.” Equally effective was imagining walking through our apartment and finding the 10 words, in groups of two or three, in various rooms. So, I’d imagine opening our front door and finding Sally Struthers, on fire, playing a nonspeaking juror on “Law and Order.” When I retook the eight online memory tests a month later, my scores mostly went up about 10 percent. I muffed one test, but, during it, a fly had landed on my keyboard: Confirmation of my suspicion that I don’t have a retention problem, but occasionally I have an a ttention one. In the end? I will probably keep meditating. I will definitely keep imagining 1970s sitcom stars emerging from breadstuffs. To celebrate my gains, I thought about buying Robert Wright’s “Why Buddhism Is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment.” But, given my attention deficit, the better bet might be Mike McCormack’s much-lauded novel “Solar Bones,” about an Irishman ruminating, Molly Bloom-style, on his whole life: It’s written as one sentence.

I wasn’t heading out to meet friends or do my errands. I was braving the cold for a less virtuous purpose: amassing credit on Sweatcoin, a free fitness app that awards points — “sweatcoins” — for walking or running outside. Accumulate 550 sweatcoins, the app beckoned, and I could snag a Fitbit Flex wearable fitness tracker. So there I was on an Arctic evening, deliberately taking a circuitous route to inflate my step count. Sweatcoin’s popularity began to spike last summer. By early September, it had become the most downloaded health and fitness application in the United States on the iOS and Google Play stores combined, according to data from App Annie, an analytics firm. It has retained that top ranking nearly every week since. The app, developed by a start-up in London called Sweatco, has raised about $1.6 million in financing and expects to close another round soon. It taps into the boom for health-tracking apps and devices, joining products from Apple, Fitbit, Garmin and Samsung that monitor stats like heart rate and physical activity. Nearly 350 million wearable tech devices are expected to be sold globally this year, according to forecasts from Gartner , a market research company. Where Sweatcoin’s approach differs from others, however, is in taking its ideas from behavioral economics, the study of how psychology and emotions influence our decision-making, to motivate people to exercise more. Its rise comes as insurers and corporate wellness programs are likewise furiously trying incentives — including passing out fitness monitors — to nudge people to improve their behavior. Sweatcoin’s “first premise is that physical movement has economic value,” Anton Derlyatka, a Sweatcoin co-founder, told me. Mr. Derlyatka said the app aims to overcome our human tendency to choose immediate gratification — like doughnuts or binge-watching videos — over activities like daily exercise that offer long-term benefits. By giving consumers points that can buy goodies, Sweatcoin hopes to incentivize couch potatoes to become more active. “It’s a tool, a hack, to help all of us, not just the select few, to remain fit,” said Oleg Fomenko, another Sweatcoin co-founder. Could the app change me, a book nerd who innately favors reading over running? Cautiously optimistic, I downloaded Sweatcoin on an iPhone over the holidays. In theory, the app awards one sweatcoin for every 1,000 outdoor steps. But I quickly learned that users often get credit for fewer steps than they expected. For one thing, Sweatcoin immediately shaves your sweatcoin earnings by 5 percent — in the fine print, the app calls it a commission “to keep our lights on.” For another thing, the app counts only the steps it thinks you took outside. Bummer. I would get no credit for Zumba, spinning — or listening to music playlists and dancing around my kitchen while cooking. To help it distinguish outdoor steps, Sweatcoin collects and analyzes GPS signals and motion data from your phone. To improve accuracy, it instructs users to turn off the app’s battery-saver mode and keep the app running in the background. And Sweatcoin gets bossy about it. The first time I swiped the app off, a notice popped up on my phone: “You killed me! Do not force quit me if you want to generate sweatcoins.” I complied, and my battery paid the price. Frictionless this app was not. But then I noticed that Sweatcoin seemed to frequently skimp on points, too. On a recent day I went for a walk with my sister in the snowy Massachusetts countryside, the app counted less than half my steps as outdoor activity. Frustrated, I turned to reviews on Reddit , Twitter , and app stores where missing points are a common theme. “ Where are my missing 3000 steps!” Ian Wynne, a sports performance consultant in Britain, wrote on Twitter. “This is happening a little too often.” To commiserate, I called Mr. Wynne, who won a bronze medal in kayaking at the Athens Olympics in 2004. “It’s a little frustrating when you are outside and you are sure that you have taken 1,000 more steps than it claims,” Mr. Wynne said. Nevertheless, he planned to continue using Sweatcoin. He regularly exercised, he said, and liked the idea of getting extra credit for the outdoor activities he was already doing. Mr. Fomenko, the Sweatcoin co-founder, told me that the app’s “draconian algorithm” is meant to deter cheating techniques like, say, strapping a phone to a pet dog. And that fraud-deterrence system may verify fewer steps than users expect, he said. In practice, according to the app’s help section, that means the Sweatcoin algorithm typically verifies 65 percent of a user’s total steps. It also means that some frequent consumer behaviors — using a protective smartphone cover, walking while connected to public Wi-Fi, walking slowly with small children — could reduce your step count. In a follow-up email, Sweatcoin’s co-founders said that they would soon hire a data science team “to help us improve the speed and accuracy of this algorithm.” They also said they were working on a verification algorithm to count indoor activity. The current system seemed preposterous to me. What’s the point of an unpredictable fitness app? Nevertheless, after about two weeks of intermittent use, I had earned 47.52 sweatcoins. I was feeling pretty good — a Fitbit could soon be mine. Then I learned that the rewards could also be fickle. Sweatcoin generates revenue by marketing other companies’ products to its users. When a user redeems reward points for a product through Sweatcoin, the maker of that product pays Sweatcoin a fee. But the Fitbit and some other fitness devices on offer when I signed up had disappeared from the app before I could earn one. Now the reward choices included a workout app for 30 sweatcoins that didn’t interest me — or the iPhone X for a whopping 20,000 sweatcoins. I calculated that, if I took 13,000 total steps every day, it would take me more than five years to get that iPhone. I felt like Sweatcoin, by offering rewards that seemed near impossible to obtain, could end up demotivating the very people it was trying to nudge to walk more. As a reporter who regularly covers data privacy, I also couldn’t help being troubled by the possibility that the app could share or sell the trove of location and motion data it collects from users. Sweatcoin’s founders said they would never do such a thing. “Let me make it very, very clear,” Mr. Derlyatka said, “we never, ever sell anybody’s user data to any outside parties.” If the fitness start-up were ever acquired by another company, however, the app’s privacy policy states that “personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.” But the biggest downside for me was feeling like Sweatcoin’s behavioral engineering cheapened important experiences. When I used the app, instead of concentrating on the friends I was walking with, I kept checking to see how close I was to being able to redeem my sweatcoins for that Fitbit. No trinket or gift card is worth that distraction. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

Sure, surveys abound, asking people what they remember reading. But these are only as precise as the respondents’ shifty recollections and subject to a malleable definition of “fake.” The term “fake news” itself has evolved into an all-purpose smear, used by politicians and the president to deride journalism they don’t like. But now the first hard data on fake-news consumption has arrived. Researchers last week posted an analysis of the browsing histories of thousands of adults during the run-up to the 2016 election — a real-time picture of who viewed which fake stories, and what real news those people were seeing at the same time. The reach of fake news was wide indeed, the study found, yet also shallow. One in four Americans saw at least one false story, but even the most eager fake-news readers — deeply conservative supporters of President Trump — consumed far more of the real kind, from newspaper and network websites and other digital sources. While the research can’t settle the question of whether misinformation was pivotal in the 2016 election, the findings give the public and researchers the first solid guide to asking how its influence may have played out. That question will become increasingly important as online giants like Facebook and Google turn to shielding their users from influence by Russian operatives and other online malefactors. “There’s been a lot of speculation about the effect of fake news and a lot of numbers thrown around out of context, which get people exercised,” said Duncan Watts, a research scientist at Microsoft who has argued that misinformation had a negligible effect on the election results. “What’s nice about this paper is that it focuses on the actual consumers themselves.” In the new study, a trio of political scientists — Brendan Nyhan of Dartmouth College (a regular contributor to The Times’s Upshot), Andrew Guess of Princeton University and Jason Reifler of the University of Exeter — analyzed web traffic data gathered from a representative sample of 2,525 Americans who consented to have their online activity monitored anonymously by the survey and analytic firm YouGov. The data included website visits made in the weeks before and after the 2016 election, and a measure of political partisanship based on overall browsing habits. (The vast majority of participants favored Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton.) The team defined a visited website as fake news if it posted at least two demonstrably false stories, as defined by economists Hunt Allcott and Matthew Gentzkow in research published last year . On 289 such sites, about 80 percent of bogus articles supported Mr. Trump. The online behavior of the participants was expected in some ways, but surprising in others. Consumption broke down along partisan lines: the most conservative 10 percent of the sample accounted for about 65 percent of visits to fake news sites. Pro-Trump users were about three times more likely to visit fake news sites supporting their candidate than Clinton partisans were to visit bogus sites promoting her. Still, false stories were a small fraction of the participants’ overall news diet, regardless of political preference: just 1 percent among Clinton supporters, and 6 percent among those pulling for Mr. Trump. Even conservative partisans viewed just five fake news articles, on average, over more than five weeks. There was no way to determine from the data how much, or whether, people believed what they saw on these sites. But many of these were patently absurd, like one accusing Mrs. Clinton of a “Sudden Move of $1.8 Billion to Qatar Central Bank,” or a piece headlined “Video Showing Bill Clinton With a 13-Year-Old Plunges Race Into Chaos.” “For all the hype about fake news, it’s important to recognize that it reached only a subset of Americans, and most of the ones it was reaching already were intense partisans,” Dr. Nyhan said. “They were also voracious consumers of hard news,” he added. “These are people intensely engaged in politics who follow it closely.” Given the ratio of truth to fiction, Dr. Watts said, fake news paled in influence beside mainstream news coverage, particularly stories about Mrs. Clinton and her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Coverage of that topic appeared repeatedly and prominently in venues like The New York Times and the Washington Post. The new study does not rule out the possibility that fake news affected the elections, said David Rand, an associate professor of psychology, economics and management at Yale University. Americans over age 60 were much more likely to visit a fake news site than younger people, the new study found. Perhaps confusingly, moderately left-leaning people viewed more pro-Trump fake news than they did pro-Clinton fake news. One interpretation of that finding, Dr. Rand said, may be that older, less educated voters who switched from Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 were particularly susceptible to fake news. “You can see where this might have had an impact in some of those close swing states, like Wisconsin,” Dr. Rand said. “But this of course is a matter of conjecture, reasoning backward from the findings.” The study found that Facebook was by far the platform through which people most often navigated to a fake news site. Last year, in response to criticism, the company began flagging stories on its site that third-party fact-checkers found to make false claims with a red label saying “disputed.” Most people in the new study encountered at least some of these labels, but “we saw no instances of people reading a fake news article and a fact-check of that specific article,” Dr. Nyhan said. “The fact-checking websites have a targeting problem.” In December, Facebook announced a change to its monitoring approach. Instead of labeling false stories, Facebook will surface the fact-checks along with the fake story in the user’s news feed. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

The results provide novel insights into how exercise can affect even those portions of our bodies that seem uninvolved in workouts, perhaps providing another nudge to stick with our exercise resolutions this year. I think we all have heard by now that each of us contains a pulsating little universe of bacteria within our guts. This microbiome includes countless different species of microbes in varying proportions that interact, compete and busily release various substances that are implicated in weight control, inflammation, immune responses and many other aspects of health throughout our bodies. In broad terms, our microbiomes tend to be relatively stable, most studies show. But our microbiomes can change as our lifestyles do. Diet clearly affects the makeup of a person’s microbiome, as do illness, certain drugs, how much we weigh and other factors. Exercise also has been associated with variations in the microbiome. Past studies have shown that endurance athletes tend to have a somewhat different collection of microbes within their intestines than sedentary people do, especially if the athletes are lean and the sedentary people are not. But those studies have been associational and could not show whether exercise actually altered microbes or how any microbial changes might later affect health. So for the new study, which was published in November in Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise , scientists from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign decided to track the guts of people who undertook an unfamiliar exercise routine. The study was designed, in fact, as a follow-up to an earlier, interesting animal study by the same scientists. In that work, the researchers had allowed some lab mice to run and others to sit around for most of their adult lives. Gut material from the mice was then transplanted into animals that had been bred to be germ-free, so that their guts would easily incorporate these new tribes of bacteria. After the animals’ microbiomes were established, the scientists exposed the mice to a substance that can cause tissue irritation and inflammation in the colon. The scientists found that the animals with gut bugs from the runners were better able to resist and heal tissue damage and tamp down inflammation than those whose microbes had come from sedentary mice. Now the scientists wished to see if exercise would likewise affect the functioning of microbes in people. They began by recruiting 32 men and women who did not exercise. About half were obese and the rest of normal weight. The scientists took blood and fecal samples and tested everyone’s aerobic fitness. Then they had the men and women begin supervised workouts, during which their efforts increased over time from about 30 minutes of easy walking or cycling to about an hour of vigorous jogging or pedaling three times per week. The volunteers were asked not to change their normal diets. After six weeks, the scientists collected more samples and retested everyone, and then asked the volunteers to stop exercising altogether. Six weeks later, the tests were once again repeated. The subsequent analysis showed that the volunteers’ gut bugs had changed throughout the experiment, with some increasing in numbers and others declining. The researchers also found changes in the operations of many microbes’ genes. Some of those genes were working harder now, while others had grown silent. Most of these changes were not shared from one person to the next. Everyone’s gut responded uniquely to exercise. But there were some similarities, the researchers found. In particular, they noted widespread increases in certain microbes that can help to produce substances called short-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids are believed to aid in reducing inflammation in the gut and the rest of the body. They also work to fight insulin resistance, a precursor to diabetes, and otherwise bolster our metabolisms. Most of the volunteers had larger concentrations of these short-chain fatty acids in their intestines after exercise, along with the microbes that produce them. These increases were greatest, though, among the volunteers who had begun the experiment lean compared to those who were obese, the scientists found. And perhaps not surprisingly, almost all of the changes in people’s guts dissipated after six weeks of not exercising. By and large, their microbiomes reverted to what they had been at the study’s start. Still, the study’s overall results suggest that even a few weeks of exercise can alter the makeup and function of people’s microbiomes, says Jeffrey Woods, a professor of kinesiology and community health at the University of Illinois who conducted the study, along with his doctoral student Jacob Allen (now a postdoctoral researcher at Ohio State University) and others. In theory, Dr. Woods continues, these changes could contribute to some of the broader health benefits of exercise, such as its ability to reduce inflammation throughout the body. “But more studies need to be done to prove this,” he says. He also hopes that future research can explain why the obese volunteers showed smaller gains in their fatty-acid producing microbes than the leaner men and women. Additional study could also help to determine whether and how people’s microbiomes might continue to change if they exercise for longer than six weeks — a goal that all of us, of course, have resolved to do in the coming year, right?

They are dispensed overnight, according to Italian folklore, by the Befana, a broom-riding old hag with a strict naughty-or-nice ethic. To fall on her wrong side was to wake up on Jan. 6 to a stocking full of coal. The Befana’s traditional headquarters — a kiosk-filled market in the central Piazza Navona here where vendors hawk trinkets, toys and sticky sweets — was a beloved annual pilgrimage, a kid-magnet of excitement, fun and sugar highs. This year, Roman families turned out as usual, many with strollers in tow, on a sunny and warm Saturday. But it was evident that times had changed, and a cloud hung over the market. Concerns about terrorism had choked off the event, and as lines formed at the entrances to the elegant Baroque square, police and carabinieri officers stood at steel barriers. Agents wielding metal detectors scanned knapsacks under the startled gaze of wide-eyed children. Earlier in the week, the square had been placed under “special surveillance.” Truth be told, the Befana market had been in a slump for several years. Three years ago, vendors and city officials clashed over the dwindling quality of the market and accusations of favoritism that effectively exiled commercial booths from the square. They returned this year, but the authorities drastically reduced their number and toughened the requirements for concession stands. Bitter squabbles with city authorities over the additional security measures — and who would foot the bill — had also delayed the opening for weeks, causing some vendors who had snapped up some of the 50-odd licenses available to opt out. Even though the sun was shining, Paolo Padovani, whose crèche figurine kiosk has been a Piazza Navona staple since 1926, was gloomy. “It’s been a disaster,” he said. Usually, the market opens at the beginning of December. This year, the stands were not up and running until Dec. 19, “when most people have already put up their nativity scenes,” he said. Sales plummeted, he said, because “people got fed up with waiting.” Donato Colangelo, a greeter at one of the restaurants that line the graceful square, said this past week: “It’s a sad sight. The market at Piazza Navona was known throughout the world.” “Now it’s a different Rome, it’s a different piazza,” he added. “But then the whole world has changed.” Among the signs of that change are the ubiquitous law enforcement officers occupying the square. After terrorist attacks in European cities like Nice, France, and an assault on the Christmas market in Berlin in 2016, security was increased throughout Italy over the holidays, especially in high-risk areas and at attractions that regularly draw crowds. At Piazza Navona, in addition to the checks at the square’s entrances, army trucks were parked at strategic points and dozens of officers strolled among civilian visitors. But the tight security was not daunting to some Roman families making the annual pilgrimage. Alessio De Gregori, an optician, said he had not thought twice about going with his family, including two small children in strollers. “Nowadays, security measures are everywhere,” he said on Saturday, adding that he believed Rome was immune from a terrorist attack. “We are lucky,” he said. “As long as we have this pope, nothing will happen. At least, I hope so.” The Christian feast of the Epiphany celebrates the visit of the Magi to the baby Jesus, but in Italy, the Befana tradition grew out of ancient pagan rituals and it has been celebrated in one form or another for centuries. On Friday, the farmers’ association Coldiretti estimated that 45 percent of all households in the country hung up a Befana stocking. That happens, the association said in a statement, even among those who do not celebrate the holiday, or who do not have children at home. But the holiday spirit is especially heartfelt in the capital. Rome’s native bard, Giuseppe Gioachino Belli, composed odes to the Befana in the 19th century. The composer and violinist Ottorino Respighi titled the fourth movement of his 1928 “Feste Romane” “ La Befana ,” capturing the cacophonous market. That reverence and enthusiasm seem more suited to the distance past. The holiday was abolished by Parliament in 1977, along with other religious holidays, but it was later reinstated. Now, the Piazza Navona tradition “is dead,” declared Sergio Balestrini, whose association has organized an annual Epiphany parade at the Vatican since 1986 to celebrate the reinstatement of the holiday. He said the market “used to be a fairy tale; now it’s just four bedraggled cats” selling cheap Chinese toys. “If we speak of tradition in cultural terms, it’s gone,” Mr. Balestrini said. “It’s become unrecognizable; we used to go to eat seasonal sweets and see the Befana. Now the important thing is to sell.” Some critics compared the situation at Piazza Navona to Rome’s Christmas tree, which was nicknamed “ Spelacchio ,” or mangy, because of its sad, spindly appearance. The tree, mocked on social media, has since become a sensation, and city officials are expected to decide on its future on Monday. The Italian news media have reported that the tree, in Piazza Venezia, could be consigned to the national contemporary art museum, or transformed into a wooden hut for women to nurse their babies, most likely not in the piazza. Previous city administrations had raised the alarm about problems with the Befana market. In 2014, it did not open because of the dwindling quality of the market and its products, as well as questions about the kiosk concessions. Critics claimed some vendors had been given a monopoly. Cultural events were substituted for the commercial kiosks, but Romans agreed that they just weren’t the same. “Rome always had a feast of the Befana; we didn’t have Santa Claus growing up. That came later,” said Sabrina Alfonsi, the Democratic Party president of Rome’s first municipality since 2013. Ms. Alfonsi tried to “requalify the market” by opening up the criteria for the kiosk licenses, but she was unsuccessful. Complaints these days have mostly been directed at the city’s Five Star Movement government , which, critics say, has been unable to give the market the shake-up it sorely needs. When city officials decided to reboot the market this year, they decreased the number of kiosks by half “to make room for games and recreational activities for children and respond to the true spirit of this event,” according to city documents. The trouble is, there are few child-friendly recreational activities in the square this year, save for a puppet theater with hourly shows, three stands with knock-down carnival games and a 19th-century German carousel, a market mainstay. When Viviana Piccirilli Di Capua was a child, an indefinite number of decades ago, her parents would take her to Piazza Navona on the eve of Epiphany to stroll through the kiosks. “It was such a thrill, but we had to rush home before 9 o’clock, because if the Befana didn’t find you in bed when she passed by your home, you wouldn’t get presents,” she recalled. “Over the years, the market has been ruined, losing its beauty, décor and attention to the products,” said Ms. Piccirilli, who is the president of an association of residents of Rome’s historical center who has lobbied to gentrify the market. “We were hoping to bring back artisanal goods and tradition, but it hasn’t happened,” she said. “My beloved Rome has lost the ability to transmit its beauty; why do we always show something inferior to the possibilities that this city has,” Ms. Piccirilli said. “Above all, this is a feast for children, but the only joyous thing is the merry-go-round.” ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

DeMille Award for lifetime achievement. “A new day is on the horizon!” Ms. Winfrey shouted toward the end of her eight-minute speech, which touched on the importance of diversity in Hollywood but focused mostly on the #MeToo movement, noting that it was brought forth by the “insatiable dedication” of journalists and women like the recently deceased Recy Taylor who have spoken up to tell their stories. “When that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men,” Ms. Winfrey said. She received multiple standing ovations — some people stayed standing as she spoke — and finished her comments with an assertion of hope, looking forward to “the day when nobody ever has to say #MeToo again.” Of course, Ms. Winfrey was accepting an award named for a man who had helped cement a culture of male domination in Hollywood. After Ms. Winfrey exited the stage, Natalie Portman arrived to present the award for best director. “Here are the all-male nominees,” Ms. Portman said. (Guillermo del Toro won for “The Shape of Water.”) James Franco won best actor in a comedy for “The Disaster Artist,” a biopic about Tommy Wiseau, an eccentric Hollywood figure best known for his cult film “The Room.” Mr. Wiseau, who had been sitting in the ballroom in wraparound blue sunglasses and looking at his phone, sauntered to the stage, where a hoarse Mr. Franco was espousing his love for his brother, Dave Franco, who also stars in “The Disaster Artist.” Standing nearby, the younger Franco got a little teary. The night’s first award went to Nicole Kidman, who won best actress in a television movie or limited series. “Power of women!” she said, holding up her Globe and name checking her female co-stars. Ms. Kidman won for her role in the HBO series “Big Little Lies,” in which she plays a battered wife who summons the courage to leave her husband. Her co-stars Alexander Skarsgard and Laura Dern won for best supporting actor and actress and the show won for best mini-series or TV movie. As expected, Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel about the repression of women, “The Handmaid’s Tale,” was honored as best drama, matching its win last year at the Emmy Awards. Elisabeth Moss, who stars in that series, also repeated her Emmys win, collecting the trophy for best actress in a drama. The “This Is Us” star Sterling K. Brown was named best dramatic actor, the first time in Globes history that a black man had won that prize. “You wrote a role for a black man that could only be played by a black man,” Mr. Brown said in his speech, thanking the “This Is Us” creator, Dan Fogelman, for creating his part. “I am being seen for who I am, and being appreciated for who I am, and it makes it that much more difficult to dismiss me or dismiss anybody who looks like me.” (It was a reminder of how much has changed in Hollywood in recent months. Kevin Spacey won the category at the 72nd ceremony for his performance in “House of Cards,” a series that fired him late last year after men came forward to accuse him of unwanted sexual advances.) The Amazon series “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” about a perfectionistic 1950s housewife who becomes a stand-up comic, won the Globe for best TV comedy, and its star, Rachel Brosnahan,, collected the trophy for best actress in a comedy. “Their support was completely unwavering,” Amy Sherman-Palladino, the show’s creator, said of Amazon from the stage while wearing a top hat festooned with feathers. (She made no mention of Roy Price, who had helped push forward the series before resigning in October following accusations of sexual harassment.) The Globes were draped in black, quite literally, with actresses and some actors vowing to use their attire to make a statement about sexual harassment in Hollywood and other spheres. Winners were expected to use their moments of glory to rail against the systemic sexism and silence that allowed the behavior of men like Mr. Weinstein , James Toback , Louis C.K. and Mr. Spacey to fester for decades. NBC and the givers of the Globes, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of 89 journalists, tried to assure viewers that the night inside the Beverly Hilton’s International Ballroom would be as frothy as ever. On the red carpet, however, eight actresses walked hand in hand with activists who focus on sexual harassment and gender inequality. “We don’t want to create hierarchies — saying that women in Hollywood are more important than other women,” Marai Larasi, the executive director of Imkaan, a British network of organizations dedicated to ending violence against black women, said on the E! arrivals special. “We have a platform, and we’re trying to use it in the best way we possibly can.” Ms. Larasi attended as Emma Watson’s guest. But the tone on the red carpet was not entirely serious. Smiles abounded. Along with discussion about women’s rights came lighthearted banter by nominees about butterflies (the stomach variety) and some of the usual fashion chitchat. Alexis Bledel carried a black crystal clutch from Onna Ehrlich; Gucci dressed Margot Robbie and Dakota Johnson. And inside the ballroom, the ceremony in many ways felt like business as usual. Stars, producers and studio executives schmoozed in frantic fashion during the commercial breaks and straight through some awards. The vibe even approached easygoing and carefree — as if Hollywood felt it had exculpated itself with all of the serious talk on the red carpet and the sharp-edged jokes Mr. Meyers cracked during his monologue. Not everyone was convinced. Reaction on social media was mixed. Some people cheered actresses for turning the red carpet into more than a parade of dresses. Others recoiled. “A group of elitists, who live behind walls and gated communities, protected by security with firearms, who kept secrets on sexual assaults for decades, that pretend to have the moral high ground,” the conservative activist Scott Presler wrote on Twitter in a post that was retweeted more than 4,000 times. And it was notable that many of the men who won awards did not mention the current reckoning that Hollywood is undergoing regarding sexual harassment and the role of women in entertainment. The annual Oscars race, which starts with festival screenings in late summer, has been unusually chaotic this time around. For various reasons — Hollywood’s attention has been elsewhere, the plethora of strong choices in some categories and few in others — consensus has yet to form. So the Globes could bring some clarity. One nail-biter is best drama. “ The Post ,” Steven Spielberg’s newspaper drama, could easily win. But so could “ Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri ,” about a mother (Frances McDormand) who goes to extremes to keep local police focused on her daughter’s murder. The film won for its screenplay by Martin McDonagh. Going into the night, supporting actor in a film was a tossup category, with Sam Rockwell (“Three Billboards”), Willem Dafoe (“The Florida Project”) and Christopher Plummer (“All the Money in the World”) seen as running neck and neck. Mr. Rockwell, known for tiny art-house films, took the prize, for his portrayal of a simpleton police officer . “It’s nice to be in a movie that people see,” he said. In truth, the Globes are often predictive of little. Top honors at the Oscars and the Globes only matched up once over the past three years. (Both agreed on “ Moonlight ” last year.) But the globular trophies are coveted by studios, which cozy up to the press association in hopes of receiving a box office-boosting blast of attention for winter movies. The tiny “ I, Tonya ” might get a boost because of Allison Janney’s win for best supporting actress. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

The January release date allowed piracy to flourish online, cutting into ticket sales. Hollywood imports are losing their luster as local studios become more skilled at making blockbuster-style movies. Whatever the reason, “ Star Wars: The Last Jedi ” (Disney) collapsed in China, the world’s second-largest movie market, arriving this weekend to estimated ticket sales over three days of $28.7 million. To compare, “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” took in $53 million over its first two days in Chinese cinemas in 2016. Last year, “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” managed $31 million over its first three days. Disney promoted “The Last Jedi” extensively in China, staging a red carpet premiere at the Shanghai Disney Resort , replete with a squadron of Stormtroopers, and securing marketing partnerships with companies like Pepsi, Alibaba, Samsung and Youku. But the efforts fell flat: “The Last Jedi” was no match for a holdover local comedy, “ The Ex-File 3: The Return of the Exes ,” which took in an estimated $86.7 million. Dave Hollis, Disney’s president of distribution, acknowledged on Sunday that the China results were softer than the studio had hoped for. Disney declined to comment further. “The Last Jedi,” of course, has been a smash hit almost everywhere else. After four weeks of release, the movie has collected $1.21 billion worldwide, with North American audiences contributing $572.5 million. Hollywood will try again in China next weekend, when “ Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle ” (Sony) is scheduled for release. There is reason for Sony to be optimistic. “Jumanji,” a visual-effects-driven comedy led by Dwayne Johnson, has already delivered better-than-expected results elsewhere in the world, including in North America, where it ranked No. 1 over the weekend, with estimated ticket sales of $36 million. Since its arrival in North America on Dec. 20, “Jumanji” has collected $244.4 million, for a worldwide total of about $500 million. Second place for the weekend in the United States and Canada went to the horror sequel “Insidious: The Last Key” (Universal), which arrived to an estimated $29.3 million in ticket sales — or almost 30 percent more than for its series predecessor, “Insidious: Chapter 3,” managed over its first three days in 2015. It is unusual for the fourth film in a series to pick up steam. The strong results for “The Last Key,” which is rated PG-13, can be attributed in part to a well-chosen release date. The first weekend in January has historically been kind to horror movies, as teenagers flee their families after the holidays. “The Last Key” also comes from Blumhouse , which has become a brand, the result of successes like “Get Out,” “Happy Death Day,” “Ouija” and “Split.” Blumhouse has made its name by shaking up horror formulas. “The Last Key,” for instance, is aimed at teenage girls. But it stars a septuagenarian actress, Lin Shaye, who has never before had the lead role in a film. Also of note at the box office: Aaron Sorkin’s well-reviewed “Molly’s Game” (STXfilms), starring Jessica Chastain as a woman who runs high-stakes underground poker games, took in a solid $7 million in semi-wide release (1,608 theaters), for a new domestic total of $14.2 million.

Yet few of these people actually use Paytm at the store, which straddles two dusty streets in this sleepy north Indian city in which tractors jostle with cows for space on the narrow roads. “People recharge in cash,” Mr. Singh said, after a young man handed him 20 rupees, about 32 cents, to top up his mother’s phone. The scene in Mr. Singh’s shop underscores a persistent reality of India’s economy: People prefer cash for most routine transactions, despite intensive efforts by the government and global technology companies to lure them onto digital platforms. India’s reluctance to give up paper money poses challenges for the firms that are vying to offer electronic payments, including local players like Paytm , which has received financing from the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, and American tech companies, like Facebook , Google and PayPal . “Cash is convenient,” said Caesar Sengupta, who oversees Google’s products for emerging markets. “It’s anonymous. You can use it everywhere.” Even so, tech companies see India’s low rate of digital payments as an opportunity. They all cite China, where in just a few years, mobile payments became so popular that it is now difficult to get through the day with cash alone . “In India, we’re going to see a similar rise ,” Mr. Sengupta said in November, shortly after Google introduced Tez, a payments app for India. One reason for tech companies’ optimism is that digital payments in India have increased over the past year. The value of transactions using digital wallets, the business on which Paytm was built, rose 64 percent from December 2016 to December 2017. Transactions made with the Unified Payments Interface, a government-backed technology used by Tez and many other mobile apps, went from virtually nothing a year ago to $2.1 billion last month. Leading India’s budding payments shift are Paytm and its chief executive, Vijay Shekhar Sharma. Mr. Sharma founded the company seven years ago as a way for cellphone users to pay their bills online. It is now India’s largest consumer-payments app, with 302 million account holders and 90 million active users. Customers can use it to buy goods at physical stores, book movie or airline tickets, send money to each other or order items from Paytm’s online mall. A transaction requires a quick scan of a merchant’s bar code or a few taps on a smartphone, rivaling Apple Pay or Venmo in simplicity. Mr. Sharma aspires to put his company at the center of Indians’ financial lives, and he has pledged to spend $1.9 billion over the next two years toward that goal. “Our truest ambition is for Paytm to be known as the bank for this new-age, digital, mobile world,” he said in an interview at the company’s headquarters in Noida, just outside Delhi. Merchants like Mr. Singh are crucial to Paytm’s plans. The company pays Mr. Singh a bounty of 20 rupees for each of the eight or so customers he signs up each month, with additional payments if a newcomer continues to use the service. He earns an additional 18 rupees each time he verifies the identity of an existing Paytm user with his fingerprint scanner, a new requirement imposed by the government on all digital wallet companies. Mr. Singh’s phone shop has also become a virtual A.T.M. for Paytm’s nascent banking division, which plans to turn 100,000 shops across India into mini-branches where customers can deposit and withdraw cash, get a loan and buy insurance policies. “We really want to reach the underserved, underbanked customer,” said Renu Satti, who leads the Paytm bank. Paytm’s strategy dovetails with the goals of India’s central government. Narendra Modi, who became prime minister in 2014, has sought to recast his country as “digital India, ” and his government has heavily promoted cashless transactions. In November 2016, Mr. Modi suddenly banned most of India’s currency . The edict forced people to exchange their rupees for new notes at banks, setting off a short-term cash crunch and prompting many Indians to consider digital options. Still, the country’s cash economy has endured. Only one-third of India’s 1.3 billion residents have access to the internet. Of those who are able to go online, just 14 percent make mobile payments at least once a week, according to Kantar TNS, a research firm based in London. Consumer trust is a big issue. Ghani Khan, who was finishing a snack with his wife at Aligarh’s lone McDonald’s , said that someone had once stolen 3,300 rupees, what would be about $52 now, from his Paytm account. “People feel scared to use these apps,” Mr. Khan said. Although he got his money back, he now avoids payment apps, preferring to use cash or his debit card. (Paytm says that most such problems are related to thieves who call users and persuade them to turn over sensitive account data.) Merchants also worry that officials are promoting digital transactions as a way to better track commerce — and collect more taxes. Anusheel Shrivastava, a top Kantar executive in India, said his firm found that 6 percent of mobile phone users made at least one digital transaction a day in 2017, up from 2 percent in 2016. That number is likely to increase further when WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Facebook, adds payments to its service in the next few months. Paytm stands out in part because of the 10,000 employees that it has in the field to help new businesses use the service, educate existing ones about new features and troubleshoot problems. There are about six million merchants in its network, from giant multinationals like Uber to tiny neighborhood sweet shops. “We have to train them, we have to retrain them, we have to visit them,” said Yashwin Gupta, who oversees a team of 65 Paytm representatives in the region that includes Aligarh. “That’s our daily job.” The job is getting easier now that Paytm is better known. Last month, Mukesh Gupta sought Paytm’s help in setting up the service for his toy shop here after 10 to 20 percent of his customers asked to pay with Paytm. “People like to spend money on more than just needs,” he said. Aligarh, with 1.2 million residents, is a barometer for Paytm’s progress because it’s a midsize city, and because Mr. Sharma, the company’s chief executive, grew up nearby. On one visit home, he said, he met a Hindi-speaking merchant who did not know how to get money out of Paytm and into his bank. The problem? Paytm’s app for merchants was in English, and the icons were not clear enough for those who did not speak the language. Paytm soon developed a Hindi version. In recent months, skeptics have questioned whether Paytm can maintain its growth. The new regulations requiring customer verification could turn off some customers. The company is also spending heavily on incentives, such as giving cash back on certain purchases and free credit-card processing for merchants. Mr. Sharma said such expenses were necessary investments. “The only way to grow digital transactions is to make them free,” he said. “This is a culturally different country being built.” ', 0, 1, 5, 1),

Along the way, she passes a newspaper and street signs that say, “Hollywood Sexual Harassment Scandal Reaches New Lows” and “U.S. Senator Accused of Groping.” When she gets into the car, she sees another sign that says, “Ride-Hail Drivers Suspected of Rape.” The car doors lock, and the driver turns around and suggestively asks, “Shall we?” Just then, “#MeToo” pops up on her phone’s screen. “When you accept a ride from a ride-hail app, you also accept the risks that come with it,” Ms. Anderson says in a voice-over. “Many ride-hail companies consider their drivers third-party providers, so they don’t have to accept any responsibility or accountability for their actions. Always ride responsibly.” The 60-second ad, to be released Monday, is the third in a campaign introduced in 2015 by the National Limousine Association to promote Ride Responsibly , an initiative that encourages riders to “think before you app.” It is an attempt by the association to focus on allegations of attacks by drivers for ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft, which happen to be its competitors. In November, for instance, two women sued Uber, claiming their drivers raped them in separate cases in Florida and California. And last month an Uber driver in Beirut, Lebanon, was arrested in connection with the killing of Rebecca Dykes, a British diplomat. In September, when Transport for London, the agency that oversees that city’s subways, buses and taxis, declined to renew Uber’s license to operate there, it said that “Uber’s approach and conduct demonstrate a lack of corporate responsibility in relation to a number of issues.” They included, it said, how Uber deals with serious criminal offenses and conducts driver background checks. Although Ms. Anderson said the new ad was aimed at young ride-hailing customers, Scott Solombrino, a founder of the National Limousine Association and the chief executive of Dav El/Boston Coach, said it was also directed at corporate travel managers. He said these managers “might not understand the risk factors” of using companies like Uber and Lyft, which he said were trying to move “into the corporate space.” Some experts, however, question the association’s strategy and messaging. “Some believe they can use regulation and scare tactics to halt an industry’s advancement,” said Greeley S. Koch, executive director of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives, a trade group. “Business travelers are smart. They will make the best decision for their needs based on cost, convenience and safety.” Gary L. Kessler, a member of the limousine group, said that “any conversations about safety in ground transportation are valid and productive discourses to have.” But not conversations that “oversimplify matters and demonize particular market participants,” added Mr. Kessler, whose chauffeur service, Carey International, recently established a partnership with Gett, a ride-sharing company backed by Volkswagen. Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst for Atmosphere Research, suggested that “anyone who thinks the N.L.A. is sponsoring this purely out of the goodness of its heart is naïve.” “The N.L.A. is sponsoring this because undoubtedly on-demand transportation networks are taking a meaningful amount of their business,” he said. Asked to comment on the Ride Responsibly campaign, a Lyft spokeswoman, Alexandra LaManna, said it “misleads consumers about the many benefits and safety features of Lyft.” “All drivers must pass rigorous screenings, including criminal background and driving-record checks, before they’re able to drive for Lyft, and every ride is covered by a $1 million liability insurance policy,” she added. “Implying otherwise is simply not true.” Brooke Anderson, a spokeswoman for Uber, acknowledged that “no means of transportation is 100 percent free of incidents and accidents,” but added, “Uber feels a responsibility to contribute to safety, help fight tough issues and mitigate any incidents.” Among the measures that Uber uses to promote these efforts, she said, are logging the driver’s information and making it available to the rider to verify the right car; tracking every trip with GPS technology; screening drivers; and offering a feature that lets riders and drivers send details of their trips to others who can monitor them. The first video by the campaign, in 2015, was animated and did not involve Ms. Anderson. Her first video for the campaign, in 2016, featured her playing “The Driving Game,” interviewing contestants to be her driver. She helped create the campaign’s second and third videos, and said that although she felt the second video should be “fun” to get viewers’ attention, she wanted the latest one “to be a more serious message, a more serious approach, with so many sexual assaults in the climate today.” For the latest effort, Ms. Anderson also enlisted Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment — an organization that works nationwide to prevent sexual assault and heal survivors. On Monday, P.A.V.E. is starting a letter-writing campaign asking elected officials in every state to require ride-hailing services to adhere to minimum safety standards; it will also introduce a related social media campaign and website, www.RideHailingSafely.com .

But instead, she was standing among other stranded passengers amid stacks and stacks of luggage at Kennedy International Airport in New York on Sunday afternoon. Ms. Dorris, 40, an accountant who arrived at the airport on Saturday night, had no idea when her connecting flight would leave. “When the flight was suspended, I literally cried,” she said. “Because I’m here alone and I have nowhere to go. And you can’t tell me when I’m going to get home. And I have to work tomorrow.” Kennedy Airport remained in disarray on Sunday, three days after New York City’s first major snowstorm of 2018 disrupted operations. Since the storm, a lingering, bone-chilling cold and a series of missteps have contributed to a logjam that has left thousands of travelers stranded and caused hundreds of flights to be canceled or diverted. The disorder at J.F.K., one of the world’s busiest airports, rippled across the world, affecting passengers as far away as Beijing. Flights headed to New York were forced to turn back, and connecting flights that were only supposed to bring passengers to New York for a brief stay were grounded indefinitely. On Sunday, just as there were signs that things were finally improving, a water main break in a terminal plunged the airport back into chaos. The flooding — three inches in parts of Terminal 4 — compounded the confusion that had gripped parts of Kennedy all weekend, as airlines tried to rebound from the cancellation of thousands of flights because of the storm. Officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates Kennedy Airport, were still trying to sort out what had gone wrong on Saturday when they had to scramble on Sunday to cope with the burst pipe. In a news conference on Sunday evening, Rick Cotton, the executive director of the Port Authority, said that he was ordering an investigation of the water main break and the continuing flight problems. He emphasized that the terminal with the flooding was operated by a private company, not the Port Authority. For the second day in a row, the Port Authority had to ask federal aviation officials to block some international flights from landing at Kennedy. That order would add to the two dozen flights that had been diverted to other airports since Saturday. The protracted chaos at the airport drew harsh condemnation from Senator Chuck Schumer, who called for “a thorough review” of the airport and the Port Authority to find out what went wrong, especially since Thursday’s storm had not come as a surprise. “They should have been way better prepared, plain and simple,” he said. “J.F.K. has to follow the Boy Scouts’ motto: ‘Be prepared.’ They weren’t.” Mr. Cotton said he too wanted a review of how and why the system had broken down. Mr. Cotton, an appointee of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, and the Port Authority’s director of aviation, Huntley Lawrence, were at Kennedy Airport on Sunday to address concerns. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo referred an inquiry to the Port Authority. Mr. Lawrence said the airport would resume normal operations on Monday. Though the Port Authority serves as the landlord and overall operator of the airport, maintaining the runways and roadways, the airlines and other private companies operate the six terminals and are responsible for getting passengers and their baggage on and off planes, and the planes to and from the gates. Mr. Cotton said the trouble this weekend resulted from miscommunication between some terminal operators and the airlines that are their tenants. With operations on the ground slowed in the aftermath of the storm by frozen equipment and understaffed crews, the airlines should not have brought as many planes to Kennedy as they did, Mr. Cotton said. The incoming traffic proved overwhelming, he said. “What broke down — and it broke down badly — was the coordination between terminal operators and the airlines to assure that there were gates available for the arriving airplanes,” Mr. Cotton said. He said some airlines reached out to the Port Authority for help on Saturday, but not before the situation at Terminal 1 had reached a crisis. One goal of the review of the situation will be to determine how the Port Authority can provide aid sooner, he said. While Kennedy has remained open since Friday morning, parts of it had sunk into complete dysfunction, with planes full of passengers sitting for several hours on taxiways with no place to go. Passengers on more than two dozen flights were transported on buses while their luggage remained on the planes. Brittany Morris, 20, of Stow, Ohio, waited hours Sunday for an Air France flight to Paris as part of a group headed to a study-abroad program through Kent State University. “I hate traveling in the first place, so this is like kind of a nightmare,” she said. Another student, Bekah Baker, propped herself against a pillar at the airport with a laptop. By midafternoon, she had been sitting in the same spot for about five hours, and her delayed flight was not scheduled to leave for another six. The international gates at Terminal 1 and Terminal 4 were nearly paralyzed during the weekend. On Saturday evening, international flights bound for Terminal 1 were blocked from arriving, and there were reports of passengers in Terminal 4 growing so restless over a canceled flight that fights broke out. Then on Sunday, the broken water main sent people fleeing in a partial evacuation and left bags and suitcases in water. Entire areas of the terminal, including the heavily used bathrooms at both ends of the ground floor waiting area, were cordoned off. Outside, the taxi stand was shut down while the traffic lanes closest to the terminal were cleared. “You would think with water mains breaking all over town they would have a contingency plan,” said Michael Rossiter, 54, of Jersey City. “A couple of guys with squeegees doesn’t seem to do the job.” As Mr. Rossiter waited, water spread across the terminal floor, flooding a diner and newsstand while terminal employees, state troopers and others rushed to sop up water with wide-brushed mops. Mr. Rossiter said he and his family “just want to get home — and now this.” ', 0, 0, 5, 1);

He was 88. The cause was pneumonia, the company said on Saturday in announcing his death. It did not say where he died. Mr. Toyoda served as Toyota’s seventh president, from 1992 to 1995, and led the company’s first American factory, an unprecedented collaboration with General Motors that fused Japanese factory methodology with the American labor force and union system. The factory, called New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., and based in Fremont, Calif., led to far-reaching changes in how American factory work was done and spurred Toyota’s international growth. It produced the Chevrolet Nova and the Toyota Corolla, among other vehicles, before closing in 2010. “What the Americans learned because of Tatsuro’s leadership was a totally different way of doing manufacturing,” said Jeffrey Liker, the author of “The Toyota Way” and a professor of industrial and operations engineering at the University of Michigan. “And for Toyota, it was one of the keys to their being a global company that sells ten million vehicles a year. It clearly paid off thousands of times over.” Born on June 1, 1929, in Nagoya, Japan, Mr. Toyoda was the grandson of Sakichi Toyoda, who started Toyoda Automatic Loom Works in 1926. His father, Kiichiro Toyoda, founded the Toyota Motor Company in 1937. The company name was changed to Toyota because that was considered luckier. After receiving a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Tokyo, Tatsuro Toyoda moved to the United States, where he received an M.B.A. from New York University. One of his professors was W. Edwards Deming, an expert in quality control who influenced the Japanese approach to manufacturing. Mr. Toyoda also studied at Columbia University’s International House. “Mr. Toyoda smiles when he says that his career naturally will be in business,” a reporter visiting the International House wrote in 1958. He worked for Toyota in Australia, North America, and Africa, returning to Japan in 1974 as a director. In the early 1980s, Toyota wanted to start manufacturing in the United States, and Mr. Toyoda was tapped to head the effort. The goal was for Toyota to set up a factory with an American partner, teach them the Japanese way, even build the American brand’s cars, and learn how to manage American employees, as well as dealing with voluntary import quotas. General Motors agreed to the partnership. In 1983, Mr. Toyoda was named president and chief executive of the joint company. American workers were sent 30 at a time for several weeks of training in Japan . “Both companies are totally committed to making New United Motor a successful model of industrial cooperation between our two nations,” Mr. Toyoda said at the opening ceremony . From the beginning his approach was different. He spoke about collaborating with the United Auto Workers union in a way that was unusual at the time: “In a way, our company is a cooperative effort between Toyota, G.M. and the U.A.W.” Mr. Toyoda said. The changes Mr. Toyoda brought by putting in place the Toyota Production System were radical. In American car factories, workers were never supposed to stop the production line when they discovered problems; Toyota encouraged the practice and rewarded workers for finding mistakes or ways to improve the process. While the Japanese approach was to take the doors off a car to work on the interior and put the doors back on further down the line, American executives had resisted this technique and said it was too hard to fit the doors back on . In Fremont, the line frequently stopped, and the doors were removed. Mr. Toyoda favored an egalitarian workplace culture, eschewing executive parking garages and dining rooms. “I’ve seen Mr. Toyoda park way out in the parking lot when he’s arrived late,” said Joel Smith, the top official of the United Automobile Workers unit at Fremont . And he kept a very low profile throughout his career. “Here was this incredibly powerful person, a global titan changing the manufacturing landscape, and so understated, so deeply rooted in humility that there’s barely anything written about him,” said David Magee, the author of “How Toyota Became #1.” “He was the antithesis of the way it was done in the U.S. at the time where your car leaders were bigger than life.” Mr. Toyoda was named president of Toyota Motor Company in 1992 when the yen was rising and Japan was entering a long economic slump. He began looking for ways to cut costs and modernize factories. “Quietly, behind the scenes, he was a living example of the Toyota Way at a time when Toyota was growing very fast and needed a moral compass to keep them on the path,” Mr. Liker said. In 1995 after being hospitalized with high blood pressure, Mr. Toyoda, then 66, stepped down and was replaced by Hiroshi Okuda . In 2009, the company named Mr. Toyoda’s nephew, Akio Toyoda, as its president. He is survived by his wife, Ayako Toyoda and their son. ', 0, 1, 5, 1),
(780, 5, 'Intel Faces Scrutiny as Questions Swirl Over Chip Security', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/technology/intel-chip-security.html?partner=rss&emc=rss', '2018-01-07 20:15:38', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/08/business/08CHIPS/08CHIPS-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'SAN FRANCISCO — In 1994, Intel faced a public relations crisis over an elusive mathematics glitch that affected the accuracy of calculations made by its popular Pentium computer chips. After insisting that the problem would not affect many people, the company succumbed to public pressure and recalled the chips, costing it $475 million. Now Intel faces an even bigger test: two serious security issues with its chips that could have implications for nearly everyone touched by computing. And so far — in something of a repeat of the 1994 incident — Intel has failed to quiet critics, putting it in an awkward position this week as its chief executive prepares to take the stage at one of the world’s biggest tech trade shows. The cause of the new public relations crisis is the disclosure last week of two new ways to filch data from the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world’s computers. Called Meltdown and Spectre, they could allow hackers to steal the entire memory contents of computers and spur the discovery of new attacks. “It is a very big deal, because it’s an area people haven’t looked at before,” said Bruce Schneier, a computer security expert and lecturer at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. “Everybody is going to start now.” Intel was privately informed of the issues by security researchers in June. The company, which has rejected doing a chip recall or other costly remedies, said it has quietly marshaled a coalition of software, hardware and cloud services to develop and deploy programming tweaks that are designed to close most of the security gaps. Intel and its partners said the fixes should be largely in place this week. “We’ve gotten much more mature in our ability to respond,” said Steven L. Smith, an Intel vice president who was closely involved in the Pentium crisis and is now overseeing its handling of the new security issues. But just how well the proposed fixes work remains a matter of debate, putting Brian Krzanich, Intel’s chief executive, in the hot seat. Mr. Krzanich is scheduled to help kick off the International CES trade show , one of the biggest tech conventions of the year, at a Las Vegas hotel on Monday night. Now he may need to address the chip security problems in addition to topics like artificial intelligence, virtual reality and self-driving cars. Adding to Intel’s image challenges is that Mr. Krzanich sold about $39 million in Intel shares in late November, after the company learned of the chip security problems. A company spokesman said the sale had been unrelated to the security issues and followed a prearranged annual trading plan. Mr. Krzanich, who reduced his holdings by about 50 percent, “continues to hold shares in line with corporate guidelines,” Intel said. Meltdown and Spectre were identified by a team at Google, with their work augmented by researchers from other organizations. Meltdown affects only Intel chips. Spectre also affects chip designs from companies such Advanced Micro Devices and ARM Holdings, whose technology is used in most smartphones. Intel, largely by virtue of its success, has the most at stake. While the Pentium chip underpinned most PCs running Microsoft operating systems in 1994, Intel processors are now also used in all Apple Macintosh systems and more than 95 percent of the chips used by cloud services and data centers run by corporations. Its technological reach means that both Meltdown and Spectre could affect just about anyone who uses the internet. “We created a microprocessor monoculture,” said Bryan Cantrill, chief technology officer at Joyent, a cloud service owned by Samsung. “There are dangers associated with that.” Intel’s situation is complicated by history and semantics. The Pentium problem was caused by a design error. But Meltdown and Spectre attacks exploit a common speed-boosting technique in chips called speculative execution that Intel’s Mr. Smith insisted is working as it should. That approach to chip design emerged before researchers developed new ways to spy on such internal operations, using what they call “side-channel” analysis, Mr. Smith said. As a result, the security issues that were discovered were not flaws or bugs, he said. The features that hackers could exploit are a bit like a door or window in a house, which burglars can exploit but that builders would not consider leaving out. That hasn’t stopped an uproar from security researchers and tech industry executives. One widely distributed barb came from Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system, who posted a testy message last week advising Intel to “take a long hard look” at its chips “and actually admit that they have issues instead of writing P.R. blurbs that say that everything works as designed.” Major users of Intel chips — including Apple and the cloud computing arms of Google and Amazon — have said they deployed security fixes recommended by Intel and so far they have not reported the sharp performance slowdowns of the sort some experts projected. But the solutions are far from perfect . While Meltdown’s effects can be mitigated with updated operating systems, countering Spectre requires more complex steps like updating computer code stored in the chips themselves — or in some applications like web browsers, Intel recommends inserting special instructions in places that security professionals said may be hard to identify. Mr. Smith said Intel and its partners had originally planned to disclose the security problems and their proposed solutions on Jan. 9, before the news was broken last week in The Register, a tech publication. Mr. Smith said the company did not disclose the issues when they were informed of them in June because Intel needed time to analyze the issues and then develop and test remedies. Many security professionals said they accepted the argument. “This is not a simple ‘we found a bug, here’s a patch and we are done,’” Mr. Schneier said. Whether Intel’s actions to address Meltdown and Spectre will be enough for the company to sidestep a sizable financial hit is unclear. At least one lawsuit seeking class action status has been filed against Intel, and some industry executives expect more litigation to come. At a minimum, Intel engineers working on future microprocessors now face the additional labor of trying to make them less susceptible to the new kinds of attacks. Using the software fixes, “we already have the security improvement that we are seeking to get,” Mr. Smith said. But making internal changes to the chips could handle those changes more efficiently, he said. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),
(787, 5, 'Bannon Needs Breitbart. Does Breitbart Need Bannon?', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/business/media/steve-bannon-breitbart.html?partner=rss&emc=rss', '2018-01-08 00:48:07', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/08/business/08BREITBART/08BREITBART-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'In the weeks after Stephen K. Bannon’s ouster from the Trump White House last August, his flagship organization Breitbart News verged, at times, on a Bannon vanity project. Ads on the website promoted fidget spinners emblazoned with Mr. Bannon’s likeness ($7.95 each) and a 212-page hagiography — “ Bannon: Always the Rebel ,” by Keith Koffler. Breitbart writers were dispatched to Alabama to boost the Senate bid of Mr. Bannon’s preferred candidate, Roy S. Moore. But as Mr. Moore’s loss last month suggested, Mr. Bannon’s influence only stretches so far — a lesson that he is now confronting in humbling terms, as his leadership of Breitbart, arguably the most influential right-wing website, is suddenly in doubt. Mr. Bannon’s belief that his own cult of personality could satisfy Breitbart readers has run into the fallout from his brazen criticisms of President Trump, published by Michael Wolff in the book “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.” Once seen as a champion of Trumpism, Mr. Bannon has been reduced to “Sloppy Steve,” as Mr. Trump phrased it, with the White House urging Breitbart to consider removing Mr. Bannon. The quoted remarks have roiled not just members of his pro-Trump Breitbart audience, but also a major patron, the heiress Rebekah Mercer, who controls a minority stake in the site, where Mr. Bannon serves as executive chairman. The question now: Does Mr. Bannon need Breitbart News more than Breitbart News needs Mr. Bannon? “People who go to Breitbart don’t go there everyday because they give a damn about Steve Bannon,” said Kurt Bardella, a former Breitbart spokesman. “We could be looking at a new world order here in terms of who will occupy the space of Donald Trump’s preferred conservative platform.” Mr. Bannon appears to be trying to stay at Breitbart. His penance began on Sunday, with a public statement in which he attempted to distance himself from his portrayal in Mr. Wolff’s book. For one thing, he claimed, his description of a 2016 meeting between Russians and Donald J. Trump Jr. as “treasonous” was intended to criticize Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, not the president’s son. Media figures more famous than Mr. Bannon have learned the hard way that audiences tend to remain loyal to institutions, rather than individuals. For Mr. Bannon, the possibility of losing control of Breitbart — the vehicle that propelled him into the national spotlight , and eventually the highest echelons of power — could present a significant test to his potency as a leader of a political and cultural movement. Among the most unsettling developments for the Bannon camp was losing the support of Ms. Mercer, a hard-line conservative donor, who said on Thursday that her family had ceased communicating with Mr. Bannon and denounced his statements in the Wolff book. “I have a minority interest in Breitbart News and I remain committed in my support for them,” Ms. Mercer said in a statement. Perhaps luckily for Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer cannot unilaterally dismiss him from his company. Mr. Bannon’s fate was probably in the hands of Breitbart’s other owners — the family of Andrew Breitbart, the founder, who died in 2012 , and its chief executive, Larry Solov, the former Breitbart News general counsel and childhood friend of its founder. Representatives of Mr. Bannon and Breitbart News did not respond to inquiries over the weekend about Mr. Bannon’s future at the site. Under Mr. Bannon, who assumed stewardship after Mr. Breitbart’s death, Breitbart News moved from a scorched-earth fringe site — known mostly for publishing incendiary articles that were deemed sexist, racist and xenophobic — to an unlikely voice for disaffected conservatives and a rallying place for passionate supporters of Mr. Trump. Its readers remain faithful to the president, a fact that Mr. Bannon seemed to acknowledge in his statement on Sunday. “I am the only person to date to conduct a global effort to preach the message of Trump and Trumpism, and I remain ready to stand in the breach for this president’s efforts to make America great again,” he wrote . Mr. Bannon’s aggressive style and creative agitprop were clear factors in Breitbart’s recent success. On Facebook, its reach now rivals news organizations like Yahoo and The Washington Post. The site hired correspondents in Europe and the Middle East, and poached reporters from establishment news organizations like The Wall Street Journal. In Washington, Mr. Bannon kept a residence at the so-called Breitbart Embassy, a Capitol Hill townhouse controlled by the site, where he courted candidates and threw V.I.P.-filled soirees. A recent book party for Laura Ingraham, the Fox News host, attracted prominent journalists and White House officials. But as Mr. Bannon nurtured his real-world aspirations, Breitbart’s audience waned from the heights of last year’s presidential race. In November, the site received 13.7 million unique visitors in the United States, according to data from comScore, down about 20 percent from last January. It also lost advertisers who did not want their brands to appear alongside Breitbart articles. The site struggled for acceptance in other ways, too. Despite employing a full-time reporter in the White House , Breitbart’s application for Congressional press credentials was denied . Its hunt for a larger headquarters in Washington was stymied by some commercial landlords who were uncomfortable about housing the business. Mr. Bannon, a tenacious and shrewd operator, may yet cling to his Breitbart chairmanship, and Mr. Trump is known to re-embrace associates even after public defenestrations. The campaign manager whom he fired in 2016, Corey Lewandowski, remains a close adviser. On Sunday afternoon, a blaring, all-capital-letters headline on Breitbart.com announced to readers that, reports notwithstanding, its leader was sticking with their cause. “Steve Bannon Issues Statement,” the headline read. “My Support Is ‘Unwavering’ for Trump and His Agenda.” ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

Shortly before, his family real estate company received a roughly $30 million investment from Menora Mivtachim , an insurer that is one of Israel’s largest financial institutions, according to a Menora executive. The deal, which was not made public, pumped significant new equity into 10 Maryland apartment complexes controlled by Mr. Kushner’s firm. While Mr. Kushner has sold parts of his business since taking a White House job last year, he still has stakes in most of the family empire — including the apartment buildings in and around Baltimore. The Menora transaction is the latest financial arrangement that has surfaced between Mr. Kushner’s family business and Israeli partners, including one of the country’s wealthiest families and a large Israeli bank that is the subject of a United States criminal investigation. The business dealings don’t appear to violate federal ethics laws, which require Mr. Kushner to recuse himself only from narrow government decisions that would have a “direct and predictable effect” on his financial interests. And no evidence has emerged that Mr. Kushner was personally involved in brokering the deal. But the deal last spring illustrates how the Kushner Companies’ extensive financial ties to Israel continue to deepen, even with his prominent diplomatic role in the Middle East. The arrangement could undermine the ability of the United States to be seen as an independent broker in the region. The Trump administration already inflamed tensions there when it said last month that it recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and would move the United States Embassy there from Tel Aviv. “I think it’s reasonable for people to ask whether his business interests are somehow affecting his judgment,” said Matthew T. Sanderson, a lawyer at Caplin &amp; Drysdale in Washington who specializes in government ethics and was general counsel to Senator Rand Paul’s presidential campaign. Raj Shah, a deputy White House press secretary, said the Trump administration has “tremendous confidence in the job Jared is doing leading our peace efforts, and he takes the ethics rules very seriously and would never compromise himself or the administration.” Christine Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Kushner Companies, said the company has partners around the world. It “does no business,” she said, “with foreign sovereigns or governments, and is not precluded from doing business with any foreign company simply because Jared is working in the government.” Menora, which is also Israel’s largest manager of pension funds, has done numerous other real estate deals, including several in the United States, said the Menora executive, Ran Markman, who is the company’s head of real estate. He said he had never met Mr. Kushner. In negotiating the deal with Kushner Companies, Mr. Markman said, he worked with Laurent Morali, the firm’s president. The deal was “not done because of the so-called connections of Jared Kushner or Donald Trump,” Mr. Markman said. “The connection to the president was not an issue. It didn’t make us do the deal, it didn’t make us not do the deal.” Mr. Kushner resigned as chief executive of Kushner Companies when he joined the White House last January. But he remains the beneficiary of a series of trusts that own stakes in Kushner properties and other investments. Those are worth as much as $761 million, according to government ethics filings, and most likely much more: The estimate nets out the significant debt accumulated by the firm, which has done about $7 billion of deals in the past decade. The Baltimore-area buildings in which Menora invested were the subject of an article by a ProPublica reporter in the The New York Times Magazine last year that documented the poor living conditions and aggressive tactics used by Kushner Companies, including garnishing the bank accounts of low-income tenants and turning off heat and hot water. The White House has said Mr. Kushner would work with his ethics advisers to ensure he recused himself from “any particular matter involving specific parties in which he has a business relationship with a party to the matter.” But a White House official also said Mr. Kushner had sold stakes in properties that would present unique complexity. For example, he sold his stake in the company’s headquarters at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, which is seeking new investors around the world . It is unclear why Mr. Kushner hasn’t applied that same principle to the buildings in Maryland that received an investment from Menora. Abbe D. Lowell, a lawyer for Mr. Kushner, said in a statement: “Jared Kushner has not been involved in, nor spoken about any Kushner Companies’ activities or project, since shortly before the Inauguration. He has an ethics agreement, reviewed by lawyers, with which he is in full compliance. Connecting any of his well-publicized trips to the Middle East to anything to do with Kushner Companies or its businesses is nonsensical and is a stretch to write a story where none actually exists.” But Mr. Sanderson, the lawyer who specializes in government ethics, said, “Their standard seems like some version of ‘It’s a conflict when I think it’s a conflict, and I’ll make that judgment myself.’” One issue, said Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, a nonprofit government ethics group, is that “the ethics laws were not crafted by people who had the foresight to imagine a Donald Trump or a Jared Kushner.” “No one could ever imagine this scale of ongoing business interests, not in a local peanut farm or a hardware store but sprawling global businesses that give the president and his top adviser personal economic stakes in an astounding number of policy interests,” Mr. Weissman added. The deal with Menora is one of many financial relationships that Kushner Companies has in Israel. In April, The Times reported that the Kushners had teamed up with at least one member of Israel’s wealthy Steinmetz family to buy nearly $200 million of Manhattan apartment buildings, as well as to build a luxury rental tower in New Jersey. The family’s best-known member, Beny Steinmetz, is the subject of a United States Justice Department bribery investigation. Mr. Steinmetz has denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Kushner’s company has also taken out at least four loans from Israel’s largest bank, Bank Hapoalim, which is the subject of a Justice Department investigation over allegations that it helped wealthy Americans evade taxes. The firm also bought several floors of the former New York Times headquarters building in Manhattan from Lev Leviev, an Israeli businessman and philanthropist. And the Kushner family’s foundation continues to donate money to a settlement group in the West Bank. Mr. Kushner’s close relationship with Israeli officials has even come up in the investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Michael T. Flynn , the former Trump national security adviser, spoke with the Russian ambassador ahead of a United Nations Security Council vote to condemn Israel’s building of settlements in late 2016, according to court documents filed by Mr. Mueller’s office. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel had asked the Trump transition team to lobby other countries to help Israel, according to people briefed on the inquiry. A “very senior member” of the presidential transition team directed Mr. Flynn to discuss the resolution, the court documents said. Mr. Trump’s lawyers believe that unnamed aide was Mr. Kushner, according to a lawyer briefed on the matter. “A lot of people wonder whether the United States has ever been an honest broker in the Middle East, and given the positions of the Trump administration, it’s probably even more vulnerable to those claims,” said Richard W. Painter, who was the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush and is a professor at the University of Minnesota law school. Now, the United States is “sending over a special envoy who has already identified himself personally more with the hawkish views,” Mr. Painter said, and “he is getting money from wealthy citizens and businesses in one particular country.” Mr. Painter added: “You’ve got a situation that is going to be abused by people who don’t like the United States. He’s going to make it that much worse.” ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

Health officials in the United States are not yet ready to blame the American outbreak to the leafy green. Still, they say, the Canadian finding has proved helpful and both outbreaks appear to have been caused by related strains of the bacteria, suggesting the possibility of a shared source. “They’ve done a really thorough job there, and I think that gave us a really good clue to start with,” Dr. Matthew Wise , who oversees investigations into such outbreaks for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a telephone interview on Friday. In all, at least 58 people in both countries have been sickened, and two — one in California and one in Canada — have died. In the United States, the C.D.C. has so far linked at least 17 reports of illness in 13 states to the outbreak. The Public Health Agency of Canada said in a statement last week that it was investigating 41 cases of illnesses linked to E. coli from November and December. Most of those patients reported eating romaine lettuce before they became ill, the agency said, adding, “Individuals reported eating romaine lettuce at home, as well as in prepared salads purchased at grocery stores, restaurants and fast food chains.” American officials have not yet issued recommendations to avoid any particular product because they are still collecting information on the outbreak. Consumer Reports, the nonprofit advocacy organization, said it was urging shoppers to avoid the lettuce as a precaution. “Even though we can’t say with 100 percent certainty that romaine lettuce is the cause of the E. coli outbreak in the U.S., a greater degree of caution is appropriate given that lettuce is almost always consumed raw,” James Rogers, the director of Food Safety and Research, said in a post on the group’s website . The widespread nature of the American outbreak suggests that the cause was not limited to a restaurant or particular area, Dr. Wise said. “When we see this pattern of illnesses, we certainly would default to thinking that this was a commercially distributed product that was contaminated,” he said. Symptoms of E. coli infection include fever, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and, less commonly, a syndrome that can lead to kidney failure. In such outbreaks, young and older people and those with weakened immune systems are most likely to have the most severe symptoms. E. coli, short for Escherichia coli , live in human and animal intestines and can contaminate fruits and vegetables when they come in contact with feces from infected animals, according to the Public Health Agency. That contamination can happen at any point along the journey from farm to table. Most E. coli strains are harmless to humans. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

On Jan. 16, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will present a workshop titled “Public Health Response to a Nuclear Detonation,” for doctors, government officials, emergency responders and others whom, if they survived, would be responsible for overseeing the emergency response to a nuclear attack. “While a nuclear detonation is unlikely,” the C.D.C. states on its website, “it would have devastating results and there would be limited time to take critical protection steps. Despite the fear surrounding such an event, planning and preparation can lessen deaths and illness.” “Join us for this session of Grand Rounds to learn what public health programs have done on a federal, state and local level to prepare for a nuclear detonation. Learn how planning and preparation efforts for a nuclear detonation are similar and different from other emergency response planning efforts.” Bert Kelly, a spokesman for the C.D.C., said the agency started planning for the event last April, indicating that it was scheduled long before the president’s recent tweets. The workshop, Mr. Kelly said, “is part of C.D.C.’s longstanding and routine work, similar to work it does to prepare for other possible health emergencies, with the goal of ensuring the public health community is prepared for all types of health threats.” The public will be able to watch the event when it is live. The last such C.D.C. workshop took place in 2010. The agenda includes “Preparing for the Unthinkable,” to “Roadmap to Radiation Preparedness,” and “Using Data and Decision Aids to Drive Response Efforts.” “It’s a predictable response to the Trump administration, which is inflaming tensions and raising the risk of nuclear war,” said Dr. Edwin Lyman, senior scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a research and advocacy group. “Nothing would offset the devastation,” Dr. Lyman said, “but the question is, if North Korea sends one or two missiles to the U.S., are there things that the public should know, that could possibly reduce their risk?” Since the end of the Cold War, public health officials have tried, without alarming the public, to send a new message to those who might be nuclear blast survivors: stay where you are, don’t try to leave your building, or leave your town — at least until officials say it is safe. That is likely to be a key message of the C.D.C. presentation. “What they are doing now is getting that message out ahead of time,” said Dr. Mark Keim, a widely recognized disaster medicine expert who worked for the C.D.C. for 16 years. “After a nuclear detonation is when the highest levels of radiation is in the environment. People who are survivors might try to go out to a hospital or evacuate the city. If that’s the case, they would increase their exposure to radiation and that’s where more deaths would occur, even more than the detonation itself.” Dr. Keim said he worked on one recent study that showed that more than 250,000 people could survive a ten kiloton nuclear bomb on a city by simply staying where they are. The state of Hawaii has recently begun a public awareness campaign, including resurrecting and testing a warning siren system used during the Cold War. It is running a series of advertisements advising the public to remain indoors if such an attack were to occur. Meanwhile, in New York, old Cold War signs designating nuclear fallout shelters that are now defunct have been removed of late, from many buildings, including schools. ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

The £1,300 ($1,750) Aibo robot, which Sony says behaves like a real dog and responds to voice commands, was on show at a conference in Las Vegas on Monday. \'Aibo is an autonomous robot and will quickly become a member of your family, right Aibo?\' Sony\'s President &amp; CEO Kazuo Hirai said in an exchange on stage. But the robo-dog didn\'t respond, prompting Hirai to remark, \'ignored me there\' before quickly passing Aibo back to its handlers. Aibo is billed as a pet that behaves like a puppy using artificial intelligence (AI) to learn and interact with its owner and surroundings.  The reborn Aibo features new actuator technology allowing it move more smoothly and naturally like a real dog. With sensing and AI technologies, Aibo can run toward its owner and detect smiles and words of praise, and can remember what actions please the owner. Its eyes are made of organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays making it capable of diverse expressions. The robot comes with an array of sensors, cameras and microphones and boasts internet connectivity, allowing owners to play with the pet remotely via smartphone.  Sony has revived Aibo, a robot that learns how to interact with its owner and is \'capable of building loving relationships\', after discontinuing the gadget in 2006. The new version of the 30-centimetre (one foot) hound has already launched in Japan, but Sony says it plans to release the robot across the globe later this year. The onstage gaff occurred during Sony\'s press conference ahead of the global Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. \'It\'s a little nervous\' Hirai joked as the robotic dog was brought to the stage.  Aibo was billed as a pet that behaves like a puppy using artificial intelligence (AI) to learn and interact with its owner and surroundings. \'Because of Aibo\'s artificial intelligence and image sensing technology, over time, Aibo will actually recognise you and actually deepen its emotional bond with each and every one of its owners,\' Hirai said during a speech onstage. \'The new Aibo is also connected to the cloud and your wireless network, and continually accesses knowledge accumulated.\' According to Hirai, it\'s both \'a charming companion and technological feat.\' The robotic dog was first launched by Sony back in 1999 but discontinued seven years later thanks to financial troubles at the firm. The CEO promised that those who pre-ordered the new Aibo this past November would receive it \'very, very soon.\' Sony revealed several new products designed to take your entertainment experience to the next level during yesterday\'s conference. The firm teased a look at new smartphones that aim to capture the best selfies, a prototype 8K display featuring its X1 Ultimate picture processor, and its new wireless noise-cancelling earbuds.  Hirai showed off the new OLED Bravia TV lineup, featuring the 4K HDR X-1 extreme picture processor. The TVs also feature acoustic surface technology for unprecedented sound quality. Sony unveiled a new LCD model designed to achieve \'fast action in sports and movies,\' with blurs \'smoothed by utilizing our own backlight control technology.\' \'Backlight control technology is especially effective on a big screen,\' Hirai added. Sony also introduced its X1 Ultimate next-generation picture processor, which is said to have twice the real-time processing power of the current X-1 Extreme. In an 8K prototype demonstration display, Sony showed off the processing of 8K HDR content and a peak brightness of 10,000 nits – the highest HDR format. The firm also revealed a new soundbar, the HT-Z9F, equipped with Vertical Surround engine technology. \'It is the worlds first 3.1 channel soundbar that supports Dolby Atmos,\' Hirai said. According to the Sony president, the firm has also been at work improving the voice activation on their Bravia TVS, with the built in Google system and support for other smart speakers, including Amazon\'s Echo, Google Home, and Sony\'s own smart speakers. Hirai also introduced Sony\'s latest line of wireless sports headphones. The WF-SP700N have \'exceptional sound quality,\' the CEO said. And, \'for the first time in the industry, we have achieved both noise-cancelling and splash-proof in a remarkable compact cable-less form platform. According to Hirai, they offer the \'perfect marriage of personal style and technology.\' Sony will be releasing both a truly wireless form, and behind the neck styles in the spring. During the event, Sony also teased a look at its newest projector from the Life Space UX lineup – the LSP-A1 4K Ultra Short Throw Projector. It was given little mention during the press conference – but, it is set to steal the show. \'If you want to bring the exceptional audio and visual entertainment to your home but minimize the presence of gadgets in your personal living space, we have a new Life Space projector with built in speakers,\' Hirai said. \'I strongly believe that there is still room for even more innovation in consumer electronics.\' It\'s designed to blend seamlessly into the living room or other space, and has built-in imaging technology to allow for 4K HDR projections as large as 120 inches. The projector is meant to be placed less than 10 inches from the wall, and can hit a top brightness of 2,500 lumens. Sony launched its artificial intelligence based robotic dog named Aibo in 1999.  The robot\'s personality was shaped by its interactions with its owner and surroundings.  The initial ERS-110 Aibo model hardware included a 64-bit RISC processor, 16 megabytes of RAM, sensors (touch, camera, range-finder, microphone, acceleration, angular velocity), a speaker and actuators (legs, neck, mouth, tail).  As the series developed, more sensors and actuators were added.  Wi-Fi was available as an add on for some second-generation AIBOs.  The third and final family of AIBOs, the ERS-7s, had multiple head and body sensors, clicking ear actuators, a chest-mounted proximity sensor, expressive \'Illume-Face\' and Wi-Fi. The robo-dogs were discontinued in 2006 after increased competition in the Asian markets led to massive cost cutting.   ', 0, 0, 5, 1),

Google’s machine learning can understand these differences and match people up with the right type of wedding ads. The AdWords auction is more efficient if advertisers pay a logical price for search phrases submitted by customers who are a good fit. A September 2017 DigitalMarketer article says the machine with perfect information now teaches itself to do things with bidding that people predicted could never happen. The June 2017 Search Engine Land article mentioned earlier talks about the way in which AI helps show the best version of each ad. It makes sense for advertisers to create many ad variations and let the machine choose when to serve up each variant. A May 2017 Forbes article talks about Google Attribution using AI to determine the effectiveness of ads. Specifically, Attribution uses machine learning to examine sales or conversion data and calculate the contribution of each step in the conversion cycle. Google is continually collecting more data, adjusting algorithms and using artificial intelligence in an effort to improve the relevance of SERPs. The European Commission report linked to above shows that Google is advantaged because it has far more data on search queries than its competitors: Spammers have been playing cat and mouse games with Google and other search engines for years. They attempt to game the Google algorithm such that their sites appear higher in the SERPs. Google then adjusts the algo such that the spam sites don’t rank as well. A July 2015 WIRED article talks about the way artificial learning helps reduce Gmail spam. Using machine learning, new rules are created by the machines to identify forms of spam that have not been seen previously. It seems logical that this Gmail machine learning makes its way into the Google search side as another tool against spam. ', 0, 0, 5, 1);
