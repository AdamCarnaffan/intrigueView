-> Re-organizing a few items into folders for a cleaner treeview (not quite there)
-> Added the Administrative area as follows:
    -> Manage Feeds with the Feed tab of the treeview
    -> Add new Linked Feeds under the currently connected user
    -> Fetch and Delete Feeds on command through the UI (soft delete)
-> Began adding basic frameworking for the chrome extension (coming soon)
-> Cleaned up the UI for visitors
-> Included a FRESH Database script (with a new extension to the original framework)
-> Added Permissions
-> Added permission checks in the Feeds Area
-> Added the ability to Feature an Entry (though the Entry management UI is still incomplete)
-> Many new features planned
