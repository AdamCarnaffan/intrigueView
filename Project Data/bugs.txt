Mobile Filters should be hidden by default, visible by button

Allow multi-word tags where phrases are used repeatedly (Net Neutrality)
    when a tag is used more than 3 times, check the word in front of the tag and behind the tag.
    if either of these values are repeated for the majority of instances of the tag, they become part of the tag.
    this is repeated for the same side until it returns false or hits a cap of 3 words.

Untested fixes:

entryFetch.php
fetchEntries.php --> renamed to displayEntries.php
displayTags.php --> renames from tagDisplay.php

Fixed offline:

Updated the entryFetch page to leverage the new method and log to the log file
Added the ability to re-fetch an entry (only in code, js still needed)
Refactored the Entry class to act as the main constructor for the Entry_Display class (which acts on standard and like principles)
Renamed display related functions from 'fetch' to distinguish the difference in process
Made all EntryObject->tags array values into Tag objects
Fixed the lack of "i" handling in consolidation of tag pluralization

To do:

Continue fixing tagging
Allow for phrase tags
Add user specific view tracking
Fix Google API
Make new filler image
